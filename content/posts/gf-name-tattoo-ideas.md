Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.

Origin of inventions: How did people come up with new ideas?
Invention ideas are something that people come up with for a variety of reasons. Some people come up with them because they want to improve their current situation, some people come up with them because they have an idea that someone else may not have thought of, and still others come up with them simply because they are curious. Whatever the reason, invention ideas are something that have helped make our world a better place.

Results and Feedback: How does your project turn out?
I’m about to head out on a camping trip with my family, and I wanted to know what type of tents and sleeping bags are the best for the trip. I found a few different options, but couldn’t decide which one would be best for us. After some research, I came up with this list of the best tents and sleeping bags for camping trips:
1) national Geographic Hexagon Sleeping Bag - This bag is perfect if you're looking for a comfortable and spacious tent. It has an interior profile that makes it easy to find a place to sleep while on your trip. Plus, it comes in black or green!

2) Osprey Tents - These tents are perfect if you're looking for a heavyweight tent that can withstand any weather conditions. They come in both children's and adult sizes and have plenty of hanging space inside.

Brainstroming is a mental puzzle game that can be played on your computer or phone. Players use their brain to guess the order of cards in a deck, and then put them back in the deck so that the next card is at the bottom. The game is scoreless, but players can win by guessing the order of cards in an opponent's deck and putting them back in place so that their own card is at the top.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.

The golden rule for getting ideas: You have to be passionate about it
Ideas are a lifeblood of creativity, and without them, we may as well be living in a cave. However, if you're not passionate about your ideas, you'll likely never get very far with them. So how do you get started? The key is to be passionate about your idea and to continue to develop it over time. If you can focus on what you're passionate about and keep pushing yourself, eventually your ideas will improve and you'll be on your way to becoming a great thinker.
