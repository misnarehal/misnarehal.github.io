Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.

Definition of Innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new products or services that are different from those that have been previously created. Innovation can be defined as the difference between what was done before and what is being done now. Traditionally, creativity has been seen as the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts. However, innovation can also refer to the act of creating something new, whether that be in terms of products or services. Innovation is important because it allows businesses to change their ways and become more innovative.
