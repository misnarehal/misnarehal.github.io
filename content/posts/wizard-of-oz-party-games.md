What should you do with your idea?
Ideas are always a valuable commodity, but there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to how to use them. Here are a few tips: 
1. Get started: It’s always important to get started with an idea, especially if it’s something you want to pursue for a long period of time. You won’t be able to think of anything else while your idea is simmering in your brain.

2. Come up with a solid plan: Once you have your idea, it’s important that you come up with a plan for taking it seriously. This will include figuring out what you want to achieve with your idea, what resources you need (time and money), and who you want to reach out to first (clients or potential customers).

How to write good content
Contentwriting isn't a one-time event. It's an ongoing, ongoing process that you can use to improve the quality of your website and increase viewership for your content. Below are some tips on how to write good content and increase viewership for your website or blog: 
1) Start with a strong opener. Your opening sentence should introduce the reader to your topic and help them understand what you're about. 

2) Use verbs correctly. Each verb needs a specific action to complete the sentence, so make sure all verbs are used correctly in your opening paragraph. For example, "I eat," "I play," "I watch." 

3) Use clear language. Your language should be easy to understand and use on a daily basis. Avoid overusing words or adjectives in your writing; they'll sound automated instead of interesting or engaging.
