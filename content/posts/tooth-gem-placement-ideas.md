Definition of innovation: The process of coming up with a new, original idea or product.
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new, original idea or product. Innovation can come in many forms, but it's most commonly used when someone comes up with a new way to do something. Innovation can be seen as the result of ideas and exploration, as well as the courage to take risks. For example, Apple was able to come up with the iPhone thanks to their innovation. In order for innovation to work, there must be a clear vision and an understanding of what people want and need. This requires creativity and risk-taking, both of which are something that often isn't easy to find in most businesses.

Definition: Innovation: the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing.
Innovation is the process or product of making a new and better version of an existing thing. It can refer to various aspects of technology, business, and creativity. Innovation often occurs when a company or individual discovers a new way to do something that earlier versions were unable to do. Additionally, innovation can come from the invention of a new product or idea. However, it is also possible for innovation to come from the development of a technology that was never before used in the industry. In both cases, innovation is a key factor in creating value for customers and shareholders alike.

The Benefits of Innovation: What are the benefits for businesses and individuals?
New technologies, such as those that allow businesses to make changes in their products or services without having to go through traditional marketing or product development processes, are often associated with benefits for the business and individual stakeholder groups alike. These new technologies can provide businesses with new markets and customers, faster turnaround times for products or services, increased efficiency and productivity, and new opportunities for innovation. In some cases, these advantages can even lead to competitive advantages over older rivals.
While there are a number of benefits associated with innovation (including creating jobs and boost the economy), it can also have negative effects on businesses if not managed properly. For example, when a company begins using a new technology incorrectly or does not properly validate its results before implementing them in the marketplace, it can result in negative publicity and decreased sales.
