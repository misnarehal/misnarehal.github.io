Making your own home decor is a great way to update your look and feel without spending a fortune. Here are some easyDIY ideas that can give your home a new and unique appearance. 
1. Use old pieces of furniture as planks for the wall of your bedroom or office. This will add interest and character to the room while also being an efficient way to save space.
2. Create a small loft with some old shelves or boxes to use as storage. This can be turned into a small living area with comfortable seating, bookshelves, and a TV stand.
3. Turn an unused part of your garage into a home cinema room by adding benches, TVs, and posters for added style and power.
4. Use pieces of furniture from other rooms in your house to create unique bathrooms or kitchens!

What are big ideas?
Big Ideas are ideas that are so large, they can't be crammed into a small amount of time. They can take up a lot of thought and effort, but they have the potential to change the world. Here are some examples of big ideas:
1. A universal basic income. This is an idea that has been around for years, but it is still not widely accepted. It would be money that is given to everyone regardless of their income, so it would not depend on fertility rates or any other factors.

2. Education reform. Education is one of the most important aspects of our society and economy, and it needs to be improved in order to make sure everyone can get the education they need.
