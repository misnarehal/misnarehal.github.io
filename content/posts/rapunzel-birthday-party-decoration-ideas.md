Security and defense: Will technological advancements lead to more widespread warfare or new security solutions?
With the rapid growth of technology, there are many potential uses for it in security and defense. However, these same advancements could also lead to more widespread warfare if not used responsibly. For example, new autonomous vehicles could be used in place of soldiers on battlefields, potentially leading to more fatalities or injuries. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) could be used in lieu of human beings in order to analyze security footage or provide recommendations for deterrence. However, these advancements should be used with caution and only when appropriate, as they could lead to further civilian casualties and displacement.
