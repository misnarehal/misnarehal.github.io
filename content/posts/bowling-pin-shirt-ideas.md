Creativity in the creative process: the importance of focusing on your own ideas and not letting others control the outcome.
Creativity is an important aspect of any creative process. The ability to come up with new and interesting ideas is what allows artists to create something that is different from the norm. However, it can be difficult to keep your ideas focused on your own work when others are trying to control the outcome. One way to increase your chances of success is to focus on your own ideas and not let others have a say. This will help you develop better ideas and come up with more complex works.

Ideas: What are they?
Everyone has their own ideas, whether they are creative or not. Ideas can be anything from a new recipe to a way to solve a problem. They can also be justifications for what someone has done in the past, or ways to make something better. 
Ideas can be incredibly helpful when it comes to creating things or solving problems. However, they can also backfire if not properly considered. For example, if an idea is something that an individual has never done before, but is based on their own personal experience or insights, it may be more likely to succeed than if it is something that was originated by someone else. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that ideas should not be taken too seriously; rather, they should be used as a tool for exploring and growth rather than as the only source of information.
