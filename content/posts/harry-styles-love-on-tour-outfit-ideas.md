Make a DIY clock: Start with an old piece of furniture, and add custom features
If you're looking for an easy and cost-effective way to keep time in your home, learning how to make a DIY clock is a great option. Not only can you customize it with your own features, but you can also get creative and create a unique piece of art. Here are some ideas for how to make your own DIY clock:
1. Use an old piece of furniture as the base. This is the most common option, and it's affordable too. You can use any kind of wood or metal that you have lying around – even a old door handle will do. Place the clock on top of the furniture, and screw in any straps that come recommended.

2. Add features yourself! There are many different options for adding features to clocks, from simple bezels to intricate glass windows.
