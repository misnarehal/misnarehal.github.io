How can it be implemented?
In many ways, the implementation of a new idea can be difficult. However, with a little creativity and perseverance, it can be done. Here are some ideas to get your new concept off the ground: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your product or service to do. What needs will it address? What are the benefits of using your product or service? These questions will help you to create a vision for your business and come up with a plan of how to make that happen. 
2. Once you have a vision, it's time to start planning how to achieve it. This can be done in many different ways, but one important step is creating an outline of how your business will operate and what products or services will be offered. This will help you develop marketing plans and identify where money should go in order to bring your vision to life.

The history of innovation
Innovation is a core element of the American way of life and economy. Innovation has been a driving force in technological progress, economic growth, and social progress for centuries. However, there have been periods when innovation has not been as fruitful as others. One such period was the late 19th century when many innovative technologies were not adopted or developed as quickly as desired. Another period during the 20th century saw an increase in innovation but also a number of failures and setbacks. In the 21st century, there is an increasing focus on innovation as businesses and individuals are looking to find new ways to improve their products, services, and economies.
