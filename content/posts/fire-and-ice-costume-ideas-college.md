How can we turn big ideas into reality?
How can we turn big ideas into reality? There is no one answer to this question, as the process of turning big ideas into real world solutions will vary depending on the individual and organization. However, some tips on how to make this happen include:
1) Taking the time to think through and come up with a good idea. This means taking the time to think about what could be done, and not just what you’re thinking right now. It can be helpful to have a goal in mind before starting any project, so that you know you won’t get sidetracked.

2) being clear about what you want. Once you have a good idea of what you want, it's important to be sure that everyone involved knows what they need to do in order for that idea to become a reality.

Definition of creativity: How is it different from ordinary art?
Creativity is the process of coming up with new and original ideas. It can be defined in different ways, but in general it refers to a state of mind or approach to problem-solving that is unique and often inspires others. Creative art is usually created by artists, who use their own creativity and imagination to come up with new concepts, designs, or ideas.
