What is invention?
Invention, sometimes called the discovery of a valuable new technology or process, is a moment when an idea or design comes to someone and they decide to put it into use. Invention can be something as simple as a new way of making a product, or something more complex like creating a new method for extracting oil from coal. It can come from anyone – even people who have nothing to lose. Inventors are often able to see their ideas through to the end, and often find new ways to make their products or processes even more effective. For example, inventors who create air-conditioning technology may not have thought about how it would be used in hot climates, but they came up with a better way to cool buildings and this has led to new applications for the technology all over the world.
