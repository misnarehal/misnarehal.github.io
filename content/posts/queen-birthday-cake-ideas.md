What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of coming up with new ideas and concepts that can improve the quality of life for individuals or societies. Innovation is important because it allows businesses to keep up with the changing needs of their customers and make new products and services that are better suited to meet those needs. In recent years, innovation has been on the rise as technology increasingly masks the seams between human and machine, between natural and man-made processes, and between traditional industry models and the latest technological innovations.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and useful products or services. Innovation can be found in both traditional businesses and startups. A business that is constantly innovating will likely have a higher chance for success than one that is not as innovative. In order to be successful, a business must provide value to its customers and compete with other companies on a regular basis. A startup, on the other hand, does not have the same constraints as a traditional company and can often be more creative in their product development.
