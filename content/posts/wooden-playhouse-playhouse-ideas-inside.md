Invention and Technology
Invention has always been a key component of technology. From fire starters to jetpacks, invention has helped people get the job done. But what happens when an invention is too good to be true? In some cases, this is where companies find themselves in a predicament. For example, the iPhone was initially thought to be a hoax because its creators couldn't find any evidence that it existed. However, over time Apple became known for its innovative design and features. Similarly, the Internet of Things (IoT) is another area where inventions have led to innovation. By making it easier for devices to communicate with each other, IoT has opened up new possibilities for businesses and individuals.
