The Origin of Invention: How did Invention come about?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or solution to a problem. It can be something as simple as dreamt up in your head, or something more complex like developing a new product or technique. Inventions often come about when people come up with an idea that others may find valuable. Some inventions, such as the printing press, were developed for the purpose of helping people make money. Other inventions, such as the lightbulb, were created simply to make things better.
