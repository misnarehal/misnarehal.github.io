What are innovation and why is it important?
Innovation is a key term when discussing how important it is to have the ability to come up with new and innovative ways of doing things. Over time, innovation has helped businesses thrive and continue to grow. However, there are a few caveats to always keep in mind when it comes to innovation. First, it can sometimes be difficult to keep up with the constantly changing technology and industry environments; second, innovation often requires an investment in research and development (R&D); and lastly, it can take time for new ideas to take hold and gain traction.

Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.
