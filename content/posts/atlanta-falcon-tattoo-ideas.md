How does the creative process work? How does an artist come up with ideas for their artwork? What are some common techniques used in the creative process?
Creative artists use a variety of creative techniques in order to come up with new and original ideas for their artwork. Some common techniques used by creative artists are brainstorming, problem solving, and imagination. In order to get started in the creative process, artists often need some inspiration. This can come from reading articles, watching videos, or listening to music. Once they have some inspiration, the artist can start to work on creating their own ideas. Sometimes this involves coming up with different ways to depict a certain subject or idea. Once the artist has a good idea for their artwork, they need to put it into practice in order to make it as good as they can. Sometimes working on an artwork takes many different iterations before it is finally finished.

The challenges of invention: Describe some of the challenges faced by inventors.
Invention is often lauded as the key to progress. Indeed, many of the most important advances in human history have come about through invention. But what is often overlooked is the fact that invention can be a difficult and challenging process. Inventors must not only be creative, but they must also have the persistence and determination to see their ideas through to fruition.
The challenges of invention are many and varied. Inventors must first come up with an idea that is both novel and useful. They then need to find a way to turn that idea into a reality, which often requires a great deal of trial and error. Even after an invention is completed, there are still challenges to be faced, such as marketing the invention and ensuring that it meets all safety and regulatory requirements.
