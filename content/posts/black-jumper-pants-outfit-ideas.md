How do you know if your ideas are big enough?
Big ideas can be hard to come by, but they can be incredibly powerful. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, the first step is to find the right people to create it and market it. Once you've got your idea out there, it'll be up to you to see if it becomes a reality. If you're not sure if your idea is big enough, there are a few ways to determine whether or not it's possible to execute successfully. 
The first way is through market research. This process involves collecting data about what people want and how they feel about products or services. Once you've gathered this information, you can begin developing an idea for something that will appeal to all types of people. 

Another way of determining whether or not your idea is big enough is through financial analysis.

What are some common ways to generate ideas?
Ideas can come from a variety of places, including the mind, the heart, or the spirit. They might be sparked by something you see around you or hear in conversation, or they might be made up on your own. But whatever their source, ideas are a powerful thing and can help you think of ways to improve your life or solve a problem. Here are four tips on how to generate more ideas: 
1. Take some time for yourself – especially if you find that you don’t typically have time for creative thinking. When you’re not busy creating, or when it feels like work is taking up all your time and energy, try doing something else that’s both challenging and rewarding. This could be anything from reading an interesting book to taking a walk outside.
