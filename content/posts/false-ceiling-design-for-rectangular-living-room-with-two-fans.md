Definition of creativity: How does it differ from ordinary thinking?
Creativity, or the ability to come up with new ideas, can differ significantly from what people are used to. Many people believe creativity is a matter of thinking outside the box and coming up with new solutions. However, this definition of creativity may not be accurate in every instance. In fact, creativity may be more accurately defined as the ability to come up with original solutions to problems or challenges.

What are some creative techniques?
Creative techniques can be anything from painting to sculpting to writing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced artist, there are a number of creative techniques that can help you get the best results in your artwork. Here are three examples:
1. Use perspective to create depth and interest in your artwork. Perspective is important when it comes to creating images, so use it to great effect in your paintings and sculptures. By understanding how perspective works, you can exaggerate or avoid details that may not look as important on the surface.

2. Use light and shadow to create moods in your artwork. You can use light and dark tones to create moods in your work, or you can use them simply as means of adding atmosphere and character into your pieces. For example, if you want your artwork to feel suspenseful, try using light shadows against dark backgrounds.

The four main types of brainstroming:
The four main types of brainstroming are: cognitive, emotional, physical and mental. Cognitive brainstroming is when a person’s thinking processes are disrupted by something outside of their repertoire. Emotional brainstroming is when emotions overcome reason or logic. Physical brainstroming is when body parts go into overdrive and cause physical injury or illness. Mental brainstroming is when people’s mental processes are disturbed by something external to their awareness.
