Negative aspects of innovation: What are some potential dangers
When it comes to innovation, there are a few potential dangers that often come with it. Some of these potential dangers could have a negative effect on businesses, consumers and even the innovation industry itself. Here are four examples:
1. Lacking enough sober consideration can lead to reckless Innovation.
2. False assumptions can be created automatically and without much thought, leading to more risky and potentially harmful innovations.
3. Unsafe and impractical products may be born from passionate experimentation and creative thinking, but they could also lead to serious problems down the road if not Icarus-ed away right away. 
4. New ideas can sometimes become what we call " dragons ." These creatures are often able to take over our brains and control our destiny – but only if we let them.

The environment: How will we handle the increasing amount of pollution?
In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution. 

It is important to note that these types of technologies are still in their development and will likely have a longer timeline before they are fully implemented on a large scale. However, if done correctly, these types of technologies could help us avoid some of the biggest pollutants on Earth.
