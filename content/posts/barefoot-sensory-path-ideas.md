How to come up with big ideas
When it comes to coming up with big ideas, the first step is to have a clear idea of what you want your business to achieve. Once you know what you want, it's time to start thinking about how you can achieve it. Here are four tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1. Look at your industry and think about how you could improve it. Why isn't there enough innovation in this industry? Why are some products more popular than others? What could be done to make sure that your product or service is better?
2. Come up with a goal that you can focus on and work towards. This will help give you the motivation to keep going when the going gets tough. Without a goal, it's hard to stay motivated and keep exploring new ideas. 
3. Make a list of possible ways that your business could improve.

What can be done to address them?
In recent years, there have been a number of proposals put forth to address the opioid epidemic. Some of these proposals include increasing access to treatment, distributing Narcan kits to civilians in need, and regulating prescription opioids. However, each proposal has its own set of challenges and limitations. Here are four examples:
1) Prescription opioids are highly addictive and can lead to addiction and death if not treated. 
2) The distribution of Narcan kits is difficult and often requires an affiliation with a specialty hospital or ambulance service. 
3) The regulation of prescription opioids is complex and often depends on the669 individual state laws. 
4) Addressing the opioid epidemic will require multiple strategies and interventions that work together.
