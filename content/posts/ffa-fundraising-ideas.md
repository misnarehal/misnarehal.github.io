Future of work: What will be the biggest change in the future?
One of the most important changes in the future is likely to be the growing acceptance of artificial intelligence. As machines become better at completing tasks, many jobs that once were done by human beings will be taken over by machines. This has the potential to create a massive workforce shift, with many jobs that are currently considered low-skill or manual labor becoming high-skill or computer-assisted tasks. One way to avoid this is to keep up with the latest advancements in AI technology and develop policies that ensure that every job is filled by someone who can do it well.
