Types of creativity: There are three types of creativity: Play, Discovery, and Invention.
Creativity is a wide term and can mean many different things to different people. To some, creativity means coming up with new ideas or concepts. To others, it refers to the act of creating something from nothing.
Invention involves coming up with a solution to a problem or completing an unfinished task. Play is another form of creativity where people are focused on experiencing new experiences and having fun.

All three types of creativity can have positive and negative effects on individuals and businesses alike. If you're looking for ways to increase your creativity, it's important to understand the reasons behind each type and how they can be used in your work environment.

Lessons learned from producing innovation: What have been some successful methods of producing innovation?
Innovation can be defined in many ways but one way is as the production of new ideas or products that differ from those currently in use. It can also refer to the process of creating something new or different, whether it be an invention, a product, or a business plan.
One successful method for producing innovation is through collaboration. When two or more individuals work together, they are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that would not have been possible had they worked separately. This type of collaboration is what has been used in recent years to produce some very successful innovation successes.

Some of these success stories include Apple’siPhone and Google’s Android phone, which were both developed usingcollaboration rather than individual efforts. Other examples include BenQ’s monitors and Hewlett-Packard’s laptops.

Some inventions have even saved lives, such as the polio vaccine. In recent years, however, there has been a surge in innovation in the field of invention, with new ideas coming out all the time. Here are some of the most innovative inventions of all time:
