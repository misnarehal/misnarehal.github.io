What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a powerful tool for improving business efficiency, creativity, and overall productivity. By having more ideas, businesses can move faster and make better decisions when it comes to product innovation, marketing campaigns, and even store design. In fact, the more ideas a business has, the harder it is to stay ahead of the competition. Here are four reasons why you should start taking advantage of all those innovative juices:
1. More Ideas Means Faster Product Development: When a business has more ideas on its plate, they're more likely to come up with better products that meet customer needs. Not only do they have more options to consider when coming up with new products, but they also have time to test different concepts and see which ones work best before moving forward with an actual product.
