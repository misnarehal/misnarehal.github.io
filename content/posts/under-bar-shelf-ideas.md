The power of big ideas
In a world that is constantly changing and evolving, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas have the power to change the world, and they often start with just one person.
If you have an idea that you think could make a difference, don’t be afraid to share it with others. You never know who might be inspired by your idea and help turn it into a reality.

Some of the most influential people in history have been those who had big ideas. So don’t let anyone tell you that your idea is too small or too crazy – it just might be exactly what the world needs.
