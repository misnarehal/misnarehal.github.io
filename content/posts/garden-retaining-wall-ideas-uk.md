Types of Innovation:
It can be difficult to know what innovation is. For some, it’s a new technology or business model that is different from the ones currently in use. Others might call it when a company applies creativity and innovation to solve a problem or make a better product. Innovation can occur in any area of business, but some are more prevalent than others. Here are six types of innovation:
1. Procedural Innovation – This involves taking existing processes and making them more efficient or simple so they can be used by other businesses or organizations. This can include developing new methods for manufacturing products or improving how data is collected and organized.

2. Creative Innovation – This refers to using creativity and imagination to come up with novel solutions to problems or make better products. It often includes coming up with ideas that others wouldn’t think of and working tirelessly to bring them to fruition.
