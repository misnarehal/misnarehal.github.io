This has created new opportunities for businesses and individuals to make money and improve their lives. However, there are also some negative consequences to innovation that can be traced back to society as a whole. These consequences can relate to economic growth, social stability, public health, job security, and more. To date, there is no definitive answer as to what the impact of innovation on society is. However, from a policy perspective, it is important to consider the potential implications of any change in how innovation is conducted or accepted by society.

Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.
