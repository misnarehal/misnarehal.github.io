Types of big ideas:
There are many types of big ideas, but six are particularly important. These are called "big ideas for the future." They can help people develop a plan to improve things they care about in the present and create new opportunities for the future.
1. A universal health care system: This is a big idea that may seem complicated or impractical, but if it works it would be a huge step forward in improving our economy and reducing social unrest. It's not just a matter of getting everyone access to quality healthcare, though; it's also about making sure everyone has an equal say in decisions about what is best for them.
2. A world without weapons of mass destruction: Another idea that seems impossible at first glance, but if done correctly could havefar-reaching consequences.

Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.
