Choose the Right Flooring: When you buy new flooring, it's important to choose a style
Flooring is one of the most important pieces of furniture in a home. It can change the atmosphere and feel of a room, and it can also be used as a place to store things or do work. Whether you're buying new flooring or renovating an old one, it's important to choose the right style for your home. Here are four tips to help make this decision: 
1. Consider what you need and want in your flooring: A modern flooring style will likely have wood veneers on top that are colored in different tones, such as green, blue, or purple. If you want something more traditional, choose tile or porcelain over wood because they last longer and are easier to clean. 

2. Choose a color that goes well with your decor: One popular color for new flooring is black or dark brown.

The goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible, without worrying about whether they're good or not. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start to narrow them down.
