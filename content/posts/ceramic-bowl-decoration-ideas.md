Inspiration from nature:
Creative ideas come from all around nature. Sometimes they are simple, like a flower that can be picked up with your hands, or an animal that is easy to look at but hard to understand. Other times they are more complicated, like the way a tree grows or the way a bee collects nectar. Whatever creative ideas you come up with, make sure they are based on something you have seen in nature and that you can understand.

Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.
