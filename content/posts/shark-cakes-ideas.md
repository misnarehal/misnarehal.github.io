Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.

Analysis: How can you use big ideas to improve your business or life?
Big ideas are those which are so large and complex that they can be difficult to put into practice but could be very beneficial for your business or life. There are a number of ways to use big ideas, depending on the situation and your business goals. Here are 8 tips to help you get started:

When you have this overview in mind, it becomes easier to come up with specific steps that need to be taken in order to reach your goal.
