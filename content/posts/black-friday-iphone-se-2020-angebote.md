Idea 5: A computer game that can be played online.

Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals?
Creative goals can be anything from making a beautiful piece of art to designing a new product. There are several things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals. One important thing to keep in mind is that you should always aim for the best possible outcome. If you do not care about the end result, then your creativity will likely not be productive. Another important thing to consider when trying to achieve creative goals is how you plan on achieving them. Do not try to accomplish too many things at once, as this will likely lead to frustration and further planning problems. Lastly, do not forget that creativity does not have to come from inside yourself – it can also come from outside sources. When looking for inspiration, look for stories or articles that might help jog your memory and create new ideas.

Defining creativity
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it’s about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

But despite the difficulty in defining it, there are some commonalities that all definitions of creativity share. Creativity is often seen as a process of turning something ordinary into something extraordinary. It’s about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.
