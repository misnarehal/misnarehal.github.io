The benefits of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is often thought of as a noun, referring to the act or process of producing something new. However, creativity can also be seen as a verb, referring to the act or process of coming up with ideas, concepts and solutions. In order to achieve success in any field, it is important to have a good understanding of creativity and its benefits. Here are three key points that can help you achieve success: 1. Creativity can help you solve problems. When you have an idea that is different than what others have tried before, it can be helpful to bring your own ideas to the table and see if they are able to work together. This allows for creative thinking and problem solving, which can lead to innovative ideas and products. 2. Creativity can help you build relationships with other people.

How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: It’s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.
