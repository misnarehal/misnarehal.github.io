The Idea: What is your business using that isn't working and why?
A business is using an idea that is not working because it does not fit their own needs or the needs of their customer base. There are many different ideas for businesses that do not work, and it is important to find what does not work for your business before you make any changes. There are a few key factors to consider when looking for a new idea:
1) What do you need the product or service to do that nobody else has?
2) What are your customer's needs?
3) What do you think your potential customers will like or need?

Creative Process: What goes into creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ideas. It can be difficult to know where to start, but here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas: When you're brainstorming for new ideas, be willing to change your mind a lot. If you're not sure what something could be, give it a try. You may find that something you thought was impossible is actually possible. 

2. Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem hard or too risky. Keep trying until you come up with something that works and that you're satisfied with. This can take time and effort, but it's worth it in the end!
