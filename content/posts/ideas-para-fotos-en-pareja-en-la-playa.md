What are big ideas?
Big ideas are always something to think about and consider as you go about your day-to-day life. Whether it’s coming up with a new idea for a product or service, or thinking of ways to make your business more efficient, big ideas are always important to consider. Here are some of the most popular big ideas around these days:
1. Start your own business: This is an option that many people take on because they feel like they don’t have a lot of options available to them. The cost of starting your own business can be low, and there are many resources available online if you need help getting started. There is also the added benefit of not having anyone else telling you what to do.

5. External Review and recommendation: How do you get feedback from others about your idea?
When you're developing a new idea, it's important to get feedback from others who can provide valuable insights. But how do you get feedback from those who are not your direct contemporaries or even friends? There are a few ways to get feedback, but the most effective way is through an external review and recommendation. External reviews can help assess whether your idea is worth pursuing and, if so, whether there are any potential roadblocks that need to be addressed.

4th idea:
There are a lot of ideas out there. How do you know which ones are worth pursuing? And how do you come up with new ideas in the first place?
Here are four ways to come up with better ideas:

1. Be open to new experiences

If you want to have more and better ideas, you need to be open to new experiences. That means trying new things, meeting new people, and exposing yourself to new ideas. The more experiences you have, the more material you have to work with when it comes time to generate new ideas.

2. Be persistent

Coming up with good ideas is hard work. Don't expect to have a great idea every time you sit down to brainstorm. It takes time, effort, and a lot of trial and error. The key is to keep at it until you find that one winning idea.
