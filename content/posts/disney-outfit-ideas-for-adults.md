Lessons learned from producing innovation: What have been some successful methods of producing innovation?
Innovation can be defined in many ways but one way is as the production of new ideas or products that differ from those currently in use. It can also refer to the process of creating something new or different, whether it be an invention, a product, or a business plan.
One successful method for producing innovation is through collaboration. When two or more individuals work together, they are able to come up with new ideas and solutions that would not have been possible had they worked separately. This type of collaboration is what has been used in recent years to produce some very successful innovation successes.

Some of these success stories include Apple‚ÄôsiPhone and Google‚Äôs Android phone, which were both developed usingcollaboration rather than individual efforts. Other examples include BenQ‚Äôs monitors and Hewlett-Packard‚Äôs laptops.
