Invention is the process of coming up with a new Idea or product. It can be something as simple as a new recipe for a baking soda soda recipe, or an innovative way to manufacture a product. This can be extremely beneficial to businesses, as it allows them to quickly and easily come up with new ideas and products that they can sell. However, there are a few key aspects to Invention that businesses should keep in mind if they want to successful pursue this type of endeavor. First, Invention requires creativity and risk-taking. Second, Invention often needs to be developed on the fly, and must be tailored specifically for the business – not just what someone else has already created. Finally, Inventions must meet certain criteria in order for them to be considered patentable – such as being novel and non-obvious.
