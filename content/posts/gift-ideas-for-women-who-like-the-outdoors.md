What are some common problems that come with big ideas?
There are a number of common problems that come with big ideas, including: 1) not knowing how to conceptualize and execute them; 2) not knowing what to do with positive feedback when it's available; and 3) not being able to focus on the bigger picture. If you're struggling with any of these issues, here are some tips to help you overcome them: 
1) Draw on your own personal experience or experiences from others in order to understand what works for them. This will help you gain a better understanding of how your idea can be executed. 
2) Take a step back and analyze your idea in terms of its overall goal rather than just individual goals. This will help you figure out whether or not it's worth pursuing. 
3) Don't be afraid to ask for help when it comes time to execute your idea.

5th idea:
There are a lot of great ideas out there. But sometimes, it can be hard to come up with new ones. Here are five ways to get those creative juices flowing:
1. Take a walk: Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not even trying to think of them. So go for a walk, and let your mind wander.

2. Talk to people: Talk to friends, family, and strangers about their interests and passions. You never know what might spark an idea in your own mind.

3. Doodle: Don't worry about trying to draw something perfect or beautiful. Just let your pencil roam across the paper, and see what shapes and patterns emerge.

4. Play with toys: Toys are designed to stimulate creativity in children. So why not adults? Get out some LEGOs or coloring books and see what you can create.
