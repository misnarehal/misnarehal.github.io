Conclusion: Sum up main points.
Concluding an essay is like tying a bow on a present: it brings everything together and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. A good conclusion summarizes the main points of your essay in a concise and creative way. It leaves the reader with something to think about, whether it’s a new perspective on your topic, or a call to action. Here are some tips for writing a strong conclusion:
 Restate your thesis in different words.

Summarize your main points.

Make sure your conclusion is as strong as your introduction.

End with a bang! Leave the reader with something to remember.

A good conclusion can be the difference between an essay that’s just okay and one that really stands out. So don’t underestimate the importance of writing a great one!

5th idea:
There are a lot of great ideas out there. But sometimes, it can be hard to come up with new ones. Here are five ways to get those creative juices flowing:
1. Take a walk: Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not even trying to think of them. So go for a walk, and let your mind wander.

2. Talk to people: Talk to friends, family, and strangers about their interests and passions. You never know what might spark an idea in your own mind.

3. Doodle: Don't worry about trying to draw something perfect or beautiful. Just let your pencil roam across the paper, and see what shapes and patterns emerge.

4. Play with toys: Toys are designed to stimulate creativity in children. So why not adults? Get out some LEGOs or coloring books and see what you can create.
