The history of innovation: Why has it been so important in human history?
Innovation has been one of the most important aspects of human history, reliably helping to make our lives better. But what exactly is innovation? And how has it been so important in human history?
Innovation, as we understand it today, comes from creating new and improved ways of doing things. It can be something as simple as a new way to produce food or a better way to process oil. However, innovation can also include more complex ideas, like coming up with a new way to use energy or developing a new type of locomotive.

What makes innovation so important is that it often leads to improvements in peopleâ€™s lives.
