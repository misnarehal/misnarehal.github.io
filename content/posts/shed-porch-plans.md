Types of creativity: What are the types of creativity?
Creativity can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas or visions. This definition could be used to describe almost any creative act, but art is an especially good example because it is often associated with creativity.
There are many types of creativity, but some of the most common are: visual, musical, and acoustic. Visual creativity includes thinking outside the box and coming up with original ideas or concepts. Musical creativity includes creating music that is unique and inspires emotions. Acoustic creativity includes creating sounds that are unique and inspire feelings or emotions. These three types of creativity are just a few examples; there are countless other creative acts that can be done without using these three specific terms.

If you think about it, Creativity seems like a pretty basic concept.

History of innovation: How has it been used and abused in the past?
The history of innovation is filled with examples of it being used and abused. In the past, innovation has been used to improve efficiency, increase production, decrease costs, and create new products. However, these same advantages can also be abused if not Properly managed.

Innovation can be abused when it is used for unoriginal or unwanted purposes. For example, in the early 1900srialist countries like Russia used innovation to produce innovative Catherine the Great cars while developing other technologies behind the scenes which led to their rise to power. By doing this, they were able to stay afloat during a time where other countries were struggling. However, this practice resulted in Russian technology becoming outdated and eventually lost its competitive edge. 

Similarly, in China during the late 1990s there was a large focus on artificial intelligence (AI) as part of efforts to modernize their economy.
