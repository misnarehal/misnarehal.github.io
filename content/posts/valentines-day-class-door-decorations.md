Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

How do you come up with big ideas?
One of the best ways to come up with big ideas is by brainstorming. By thinking about possible solutions and possibilities, you can come up with concepts that may be even more interesting or challenging than what you currently think. Sometimes all it takes is some fresh creativity to inspire something new. So how do you go about brainstorming ideas? There are a few different methods, but the most important thing is to keep your ideas as accessible as possible so that everyone can contribute their own unique insights. Here are five ways: 
1) Take a walk around your neighborhood and see what local businesses are doing that could be applied to your city or town. This will give you a lot of potential inspirations for new ideas. 
2) Brainstorm with someone who knows more than you about a specific topic or problem.

The opportunities for big ideas:
There are endless opportunities for big ideas. In fact, many of the world's most innovative companies were started with just a single idea. And while it might seem daunting to come up with a truly groundbreaking concept, there are plenty of ways to get started. Here are four tips for generating big ideas: 1) Brainstorm with others. Collaborating with others can help spark new ideas and increase the chances of success. 2) Don't be afraid to experiment. Trying out new approaches often leads to breakthroughs. 3) Be open to change. Constantly adapting your approach will help you stay ahead of the competition. 4) Stay focused on the task at hand. If you lose focus, your ideas will quickly go away.
