What is creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ways to solve a problem. It can be used in business, creative writing, and more. There are many creative ideas out there that you can use to improve your life or your business. Here are 8 of the most common creative thinking techniques:
1. Problem-solving: When you come up with an idea for a product or service, it’s important to have a clear problem that you can solve. This allows you to think outside the box and come up with a solution that’s novel and unique.

2. Hypothesis: Once you have a problem to solve, it’s important to generate several ideas on how to solve it. By doing this, you get a better understanding of what the problem is, as well as where potential solutions might lead.

The definition for creativity has changed over time, but the process remains the same- coming up with new and innovative ways to do things. Whether it’s painting, designing, or writing, creative individuals have always been able to bring their A game to whatever they do.

How to start a small business
Starting a small business can be a daunting task, but there are a few key steps that you can take to make it easier. Here are some tips to get started:
1. think about your target market. What is your main focus? Are you selling products or services? Do you have an existing customer base? If not, what do you need to do to reach them?

2. research your competition. Do you have any competitors in your industry that you could study and contrast yourself against? This will help provide direction for your business idea.

3. create a plan of attack. How will you market and sell your product or service? How will you generate revenue? What type of marketing strategy will work best for YOU and YOUR business? This information should be included in the business plan (or indeed, anywhere else related to starting a small business).
