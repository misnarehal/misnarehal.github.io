Change 2: How to improve the efficiency of your kitchen
If you're like most people, you probably spend a lot of time in your kitchen - whether cooking or cleaning. But it's not just the act of cooking that can be improved by creating a more efficient system; cleaning and organization can also be improved. Here are some tips to help you become more efficient in your kitchen:
1. Create clear dividers between the cooking and cleaning areas. This will help create space for you to move around and do other tasks in an organized manner.

2. Use positive reinforcement when you see results from your cleanliness efforts. For example, if you see that your kitchen is dirty but you're still making progress, give yourself a pat on the back! This will keep your motivation high and make sure that you continue to make good progress.

3. Use organizers to help with storage and organization.

How to Get organized: This is one of the most important aspects of being organized, and there are plenty of ways to do it. Make sure you choose the method that is best for you.
One of the most important decisions you make when it comes to becoming organized is what kind of organization you want. There are a number of different types of organizational systems that can work for different people, but here are two examples: The Zen Method and the 7 Laws of Order.
The Zen Method is a way to live in the moment and not think about how things should be done. It is based on the idea that everything happening in life at any given time is optional and can be changed at any time by simply changing your mind. This system does not require any prior planning or organizing knowledge, which makes it ideal for those who are new to being organized.

The 7 Laws of Order are similar to theZen Method, but they focus on living in the present moment and using simple rules to govern everything.

The State of Invention Today
Invention is a vital part of our economy and society. Yet, it has been difficult to keep up with the growth of invention. Inventions have become more common, but the number of new ideas remains low. This lack of innovation is costing society billions of dollars each year in lost revenue and jobs.
Despite these costs, there is still a lot that we can learn from the history of invention. For example, some inventions were originally created for no other purpose than to solve a problem. Other inventions were made just for fun or as an experiment. But even the simplest inventions can have big consequences. For example, the Telephone was invented to make communication more efficient and cost-effective. Today, it plays an important role in our lives and economy.

There are several ways to help rise awareness about Invention and keep it alive.
