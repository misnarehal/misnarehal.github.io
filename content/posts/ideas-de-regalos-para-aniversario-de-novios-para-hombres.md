What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups. In his book, he discusses how it can be tough to stay creative and keep up with new ideas when your mind is constantly filled with too many thoughts. 
One challenge is that it can be hard to remember what you just thought of. Another is that it can be difficult to get your thoughts down in writing form. Finally, Fried says that it can be hard to see the big picture when you're thinking about individual products or services.

Definition of a "new idea"
A new idea is a re-interpretation or expansion of an old concept that has been brought to a new level of understanding or application. This can be accomplished through thought, creativity, or a mixture of the two. New ideas are always in flux and are constantly being developed and tweaked as more information is learned and considered.

What do we mean by big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there's no one definitive answer. What matters most is what the idea can do for people, and how it could change the way they live and work. 
Big ideas are those that are so great they're hard to ignore or forget. They can solve a problem that's been bothering people for years, or help create a new industry or global standard. 
To come up with the perfect big idea, you need to have a vision, be passionate about your project, and have the guts to take on a challenge. But before all that, you need some strong convictions (or at least a willingness to experiment). 
Here are five tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1) Define your problem: Your ideal customer won't always be available or willing to do business with you, so define your target market first.
