Definition of big ideas: What is it that you want your company to achieve?
When it comes to big ideas, there is no one right answer. Some companies achieve their goals by focusing on a few key areas while others have a more holistic approach. What matters most is that your company has initiatives that are meaningful and impactful. Definitions of big ideas can vary, but all should include at least one important factor: The potential for success. 
If you’re not sure what it means to have a big idea, ask yourself this question: How will your company benefit from developing this initiative? Once you know the answer, you can start brainstorming ways your business can use the product or service to achieve its goals.

How do we make sure that our technology helps us achieve our goals rather than hinder them?
Technology has a lot to offer in helping us achieve our goals, but it should be used responsibly. There are a number of ways technology can help us achieve our goals, but some are more harmful than others. Here are three examples: 
1. Technology can help us automate tasks and reduce the amount of time we have to spend on them. This can lead to decreased productivity and increased workloads. 
2. Technology can help us communicate with other people and devices more easily. This can lead to less communication and collaboration between team members. 
3. Technology can help us track our progress and organize our work more effectively. This can lead to better management of resources and improved productivity overall.
