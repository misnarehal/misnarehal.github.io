The patent system, also known as the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent system, is a system of intellectual property rights that allows businesses to protect their discoveries and innovations by awarding exclusive rights to those who make them.

Consequences of inventions: What are the effects of innovations on society?
Inventions have a large impact on society, both positive and negative. Positive inventions can improve the quality of life for people, while negative inventions can cause harm. There are many factors to consider when evaluating the effects of an innovation on society, including the innovation's potential applications, its social and economic impact, and how it is received by the community. Some of the most significant benefits of innovations include increased productivity and efficiency, new ways to make products or services more affordable, and new ways to solve old problems. However, there are also a number of dangers associated with any innovation that does not go according to plan or that does not meet societal expectations. These dangers can range from decreased innovationcapacity in society to harmful ripple effects on other parts of the economy.
