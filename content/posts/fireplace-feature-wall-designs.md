1. Invention ideas are always in flux, and since new technologies keep popping up, it’s hard to come up with anything that’s truly original. However, there are a few things that you can try and base your inventions off of. One idea is to take an old technology and make it more user-friendly. Another idea is to come up with a new way of doing something that has been done before but not in the same way. Finally, you can simply come up with an idea that you have never thought of before and see if anyone else has had the same idea.
