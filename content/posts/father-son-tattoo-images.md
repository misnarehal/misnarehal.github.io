Exercise: How to be creative in your everyday life
Creativity is a key word in everyone‚Äôs vocabulary. Whether you are a creative artist, graphic designer, or just someone who enjoys making things, creativity is important to have in your everyday life. There are so many ways to be creative and put your creativity into use every day- from taking risks with new ideas to using your creativity to solve problems. Here are five tips on how you can become more creative in your everyday life:

2. Use your imagination: The more fun you can have when thinking about ideas, the more likely you will be to come up with new ones.
