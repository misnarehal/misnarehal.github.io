Innovation in the global economy:
The global economy is constantly improving, with new and innovative technologies regularly coming onto the market. This increase in innovation has helped to drive down costs and increase efficiency, making life easier for consumers and businesses alike. However, as the global economy continues to grow, some challenges remain. One such challenge is that innovation often doesn't always trickle down to lower levels of society - in some cases, it can eveneaturedin the top tiers of businesses. This problem is called "inefficiency": When innovation takes place at a high level and benefits only a few people rather than everyone around them, it's often difficult for others to access or use the same ideas. Inefficiency can also lead to problems for the global environment - when businesses don't take into account environmental impact when making decisions about products or services, they can contribute to climate change.

Definition of innovation: A new way of doing things
Innovation is the alteration of the way something is done, or the creation of a new product or service. Innovation can be seen as a way to improve efficiency, lower costs, create new products and services, or to solve problems that have been unsolved. Over time, innovation has become an essential part of technological progress and has led to advances in a variety of industries.
There are several definitions of innovation that are used by different groups and individuals. One definition is "the process by which new ideas, products or services are created." This definition includes both the idea that innovation takes place in addition to existing technologies, as well as the idea that it is not limited to any one sector but can encompass a wide range of industries. Another definition is "a sudden change in state from one having existed for some time before" which could refer to changes in business models or technology.

The benefits of creativity
Creativity has been linked with improved mental health, better educational outcomes and even enhanced workplace performance.
A recent study found that people who engage in creative activities are more likely to report higher levels of well-being and life satisfaction.

 creativity can also lead to better educational outcomes. A study of 3,000 primary school children in the UK found that those who took part in creative activities had higher grades than those who didn’t.

And it’s not just students who benefit from being more creative – employees do too. A study of 1,500 workers found that those who had high levels of creativity were more engaged with their work and had lower levels of absenteeism.
