Brainstroming is a technique used by mentalists to help them discover the hidden thoughts and confessions of the people they are questioning. Brainstroming can be done by using questionnaires, interviews, or even conversation with the person in question. The goal of brainstroming is to gain a better understanding of their thoughts and feelings, which can then be used to help secure their confessions.

Invention definition: A creative act or process of coming up with a new idea or product.
Inventions are the backbone of business. They allow companies to make new products and services, without having to go through the trouble of developing them from scratch. And they do this by simply coming up with a new idea, or creating a better design than what was previously available.
However, there are different types of inventions. Some are more creative than others. Here, we will take a look at five different types of inventions:

1) Science fiction: Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction that deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It has been called the "literature of ideas", and often explores the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations.

2) Pharmaceuticals: Pharmaceuticals are products used to treat diseases or improve their symptoms.
