How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: Itâ€™s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.
