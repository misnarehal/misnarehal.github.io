The term "brainstroming" has been around for quite some time, but it wasn't until 2006 that the term was coined to describe the phenomenon of individuals being overwhelmed by a single task or idea.

The power of creativity: What does it mean for your business?
Creativity is a key factor in any business, and it can mean the difference between success and failure. Whether you’re working on a project or just thinking out loud, creativity can help you come up with innovative solutions that solve problems. But what does it really mean for your business? Here are six things to keep in mind when looking to embrace creativity: 1. It can help you attract new customers. When people feel inspired by your work, they’re more likely to invest in your product or service. 2. It can increase productivity. Having fresh ideas on how to improve your business process can lead to faster and more efficient progress. 3. It can help you build relationships with customers. By being open and sharing your ideas, you risk losing customers who are already loyal to your competitor. 4. It can help you shift focus from results to customer satisfaction.
