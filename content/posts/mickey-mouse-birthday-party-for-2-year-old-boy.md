what is creative?
Creativity is often described as the ability to come up with new and original ideas. However, creativity is more than just generating ideas – it’s about turning those ideas into reality.
Creativity is a process that can be both cognitive and emotional. It involves the generation of new ideas, as well as the ability to see those ideas through to completion. In order to be creative, you need to be open-minded and willing to take risks.

There are many different ways to be creative. Some people are born with natural creativity, while others have to work hard at it. However, anyone can learn to be more creative if they put their mind to it.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many benefits to having them. Ideas can help solve problems, provide new perspectives, and even change the course of history. Here are five ways in which ideas can benefit individuals and organizations: 
1. Ideas can help people think differently. When people have different ideas about a problem or issue, they can come up with more solutions than if they were just following the same path. By sharing their own perspectives and thoughts, people can form better plans and strategies for solving problems. 
2. Ideas can help organizations grow. One of the best things about having ideas is that they give organizations a range of options for new products, services, or directions. This allows businesses to explore different paths and figure out what works best for them while also staying afloat in a changing market landscape.
