Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other concepts?
Innovation is the process of creating something new and different from what has been done before. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new product, service, or idea that is better than what was available before. Innovation can be found in everything from fashion to technology to business.
If you think about it, innovation is pretty much just a way to make things better. After all, if there was nothing new or different out there to work with, how would anyone ever come up with a new idea? In fact, innovation often comes from coming up with an idea that nobody else has thought of before. So while it may seem like a pretty big responsibility, it's actually quite easy to get started on when you have some basic ideas about what you're looking for.

Creative people are often seen as those who are able to come up with new and innovative ways to do things. However, this isn't always the case. In fact, some creativity comes from coming up with ideas that others may not even think of. Creative people can also be found in fields that are not typically associated with creativity such as fashion or interior design.

Invention is the process of creating something new, whether that be a product or a design. For many people, invention is an important part of their life, and for good reason: inventions can make lives better. For example, in 1863, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed the first practicable Telegraph Machine. This machine allowed for the transmission of messages without the use of horses or riders.
