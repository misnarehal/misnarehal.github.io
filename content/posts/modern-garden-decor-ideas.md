4 easy ways to declutter your home
decluttering your home can be a lot of fun and it can help you save money. Here are four easy ways to declutter your home:
1. Get organized. Make sure all of your belongings are in one place and organized according to what type of item it is. This will make it easier to find what you need and move things around when you need to.

2. Get rid of excess clutter. It may seem like every time you take a look at your home, there’s more stuff than ever before, but that’s not the case! Remove any unnecessary items from your home that don’t have a use or purpose anymore. This will free up space and help you save money on your housing costs.

3. Use Craigslist or other online directories for recommendations on deals on new or used furniture and decorations.
