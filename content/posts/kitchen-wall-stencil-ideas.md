How can innovation be used to improve businesses?
Innovation is a key element of business success. It can be used to improve businesses by providing new and unique solutions to problems, or by creating new ways to do business. There are several ways that innovation can be used in business, but some of the most common are: 
1. Innovation can help businesses increase sales and profits. When businesses use innovation to create new products or services that are more successful than those available before, they can make more money and achieve their goals more quickly.
2. Innovation can help businesses reduce costs. When businesses use innovation to come up with new ways to produce goods or services, they can save money on both production and marketing costs. This is especially important for small businesses, which may not have the resources or budget to spend on large-scale innovations.

Barriers to Innovation
Innovation is key to success in any field, yet it can be difficult to come by. There are a number of barriers that can stand in the way of innovation, including a lack of resources, a lack of knowledge, and a lack of creativity.
One of the biggest barriers to innovation is a lack of resources. This can include both financial resources and human resources. If you don't have the money to invest in new ideas or the people to execute them, it can be very difficult to bring about change.

Another barrier to innovation is a lack of knowledge. If you're not aware of what's possible or you don't understand how things work, it can be hard to come up with new ideas. This is why education and research are so important for promoting innovation.

Finally, a barrier to innovation can simply be a lack of creativity.

How did invention ideas come about?
Invention ideas come about when two people think of the same idea and come up with a plan to make it a reality. Invention ideas can come from anywhere, but often they start with an idea that someone has had before. Sometimes an idea is just too good to be true, but often the realisation that it could be used in a product or service makes it all the more appealing. For example, there was once a man who came up with the idea for a computer game called "Pac-Man". This game would help children learn about mathematics and science, something that was sorely lacking in their schools at the time. Another example is the invention of the telephone. Many people at first thought it couldn't be used because it was so big and expensive, but soon realised that it could be turned into a valuable tool for communication.
