Brainstorming: What are some great ways to come up with new ideas?
This article is about brainstorming ideas, and how to come up with new ones. There are a few things to keep in mind when brainstorming: 
- Make sure you have a wide range of ideas - Brainstorming can be helpful if you have a few good ideas but no specific plan for calling them all together. 

- Be organized - When you have a bunch of great ideas, it can be helpful to jot them down in order of importance. This will help you keep track of what's important and which ones need more work. 

- Be patient - It can take some time to come up with good ideas. Don't get discouraged if your first batch doesn't seem as great as you wanted it to. You can always try again later.
