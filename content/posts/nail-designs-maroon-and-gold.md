The Evolution of Invention: From the Ancient Greeks to the Modern World
Invention is the process by which humans come up with new ideas, products, or methods. Innovation has been a part of human culture for as long as humans have been able to create things. The ancient Greeks were some of the first to come up with inventions. They had a system in which they would submit new ideas to a panel of judges, and if they were found to be good, they would be printed out and given to other people. The judges would then use their judgement to decide who should get the idea and who should make it into a product.
The modern world is full of invention. We have technology that allows us to create anything we want, and we can also find ways to improve on what others have created before us. This makes innovation something very important for humanity.

Implementation: How do we make our ideas into a reality?
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any organization. It can help a company stay ahead of the competition and make new and innovative products. However, it can be difficult to implement new ideas. There are a number of ways to make innovation a reality in your organization. 
One way is to create a culture of innovation. This means that everyone in your organization is encouraged to come up with new ideas and try out new concepts. You also need to provide support for these ideas, whether that means granting credit for invention or providing resources to help them become reality. 

Another way to implementation innovation is through process improvement. By improving the way that you do things, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to develop and/or implement new ideas. This can be done by changing processes or instituting standardized procedures.

The history of brainstorming
In the late 1940s, a group of psychologists working at Yale University began to study what is now known as brainstorming. The team, led by George Prince, was interested in finding out whether people could come up with more ideas if they worked on their own or in groups.
The psychologists conducted a series of experiments in which participants were asked to come up with as many ideas as possible for different topics. They found that people who worked on their own came up with fewer ideas than those who worked in groups.

The psychologists also found that the quality of the ideas generated was better when people worked in groups. This is because people are able to build on each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas as a result.

The findings of the Yale study sparked a lot of interest in the idea of brainstorming and its potential benefits.
