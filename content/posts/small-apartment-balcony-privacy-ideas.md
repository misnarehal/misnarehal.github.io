Ideas in Action: How to start using your ideas
How to start using your ideas? It can be difficult finding the right inspiration, but with a little effort and creativity, you can get started on anything. Here are three ways to get started: 
1. Take a walk: Spending time outside is always a great way to think about new ideas. When you’re fresh and unafraid of new challenges, you may be more inspired to come up with new solutions. 
2. Draw inspiration from others: Not all ideas need an original solution, but looking at other people’s successes or failures can be inspiring. This will help you see what works and what doesn’t in your own business. 
3. Get help: There are plenty of resources available online and in books that can help you brainstorm and come up with new ideas.
