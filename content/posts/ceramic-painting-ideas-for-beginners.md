6) Find a way to offer help or inspiration to others
There are many people out there who need help, and even more people who need inspiration. It can be difficult to know what to do or say in order to offer them both. Here are six ideas for how you could help someone who needs it: 
1. Graphics: Draw a picture or write down a description of the problem or situation that the person is experiencing. This will provide some insight and direction for providing help. 
2. Words of Wisdom: Share your own experiences and advice with the person in question, or recommend books, articles, etc., that can help them out. This will give the person something to look forward to and may also inspire them further. 
3. Opinion: Share your thoughts on what the person should do or how they should go about solving their problem.

Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but its meaning can be difficult to define. When asked to define innovation, most people will give a general and vague answer. The true definition of innovation is much more specific.
Innovation can be defined as the process of taking an idea or concept and turning it into a reality. It is the implementation of a new or improved solution that solves a problem or meets a need. Innovation involves creativity, but it also requires resourcefulness, planning, and execution.

There are many different types of innovation, but all share one common goal: to make something better. Whether it’s a new product, process, or service, innovation strives to improve upon what already exists. Sometimes this means coming up with an entirely new solution, and other times it means making small improvements to existing solutions.
