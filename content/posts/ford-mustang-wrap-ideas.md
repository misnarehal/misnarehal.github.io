Inspiration from Others: What sources can you draw from?
If you're looking to up your creative game, take inspiration from others. Whether it's learning new techniques or paying homage to classic pieces, there are endless possibilities out there. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
Start with old pieces of art. Draw inspiration from both the beauty and functionality of older pieces. Use them as models for your own designs. 

Create a mashup. What if your favorite song was turned into a visual masterpiece? What if each image in your collection was mashed together into one cohesive work? This is what getting on the beaten path is all about – finding orphaned works of art and turning them into something special. 

Inspire yourself with nature. Take a walk in nature and see how different elements impact how you see things.

How Innovation Can Benefit Your Business: from Cut Costs to Higher Productivity
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. It can help businesses cut costs and increase productivity, but there are a few considerations that businesses should make before implementing innovation. First, innovation can be risky - if it doesn't work out, it can cost a lot of money and time to fix. Second, some innovations may not be appropriate for every business - if they're not well-suited to your company's culture or mission, you may find that they don't work as well in the long run. Finally, it's important to remember that innovation often requires time and effort - if you don't take the necessary steps to implement it properly, you could see marginal results for a longer period of time.

The benefits of innovation
Innovation has become a buzzword in business circles. It is often used to describe new products, processes or services. But what does innovation really mean?
At its most basic level, innovation is about creating something new and different. It can be as simple as developing a new product or improving an existing one. It can also be about improving the way you do business, such as introducing new methods or technology.

There are many benefits of being innovative. One of the most important is that it can help you stay ahead of the competition. If you are constantly introducing new products or services, your customers will keep coming back to you for more. This can help you build a loyal customer base and grow your business.

Innovation can also help you attract new customers.
