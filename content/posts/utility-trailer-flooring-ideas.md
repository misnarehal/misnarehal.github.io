Ideas for creativity: What are some examples?
Creativity is often thought of as a source of inspiration and a way to come up with new ideas. However, creative ideas can also be generated through creativity itself. Here are some examples: 
1. Thinking outside the box – When you come up with new ideas, it’s important not to be afraid to be creative. This can mean thinking about things that you’ve never thought of before or coming up with ways to improve upon what others have already done. 
2. Taking risks – If you’re looking for new ways to get your creative juices flowing, always take some risks. This means trying out different concepts or concepts that you might not have considered before. It can also involve taking on tasks that are too much for you to complete easily or challenging yourself in order to force yourself to think outside the box and come up with new ideas.
