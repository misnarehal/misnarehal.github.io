Creativity is a vital part of any work. Without creativity, there would be no point to starting a project and wouldn't be anything to look forward to during the process. However, getting inspiration for one's work can be difficult. There are many ways to get inspiration, but it all comes down to finding what works for you and your personal style. Here are some tips on how to get inspired for your next project: 
1) Take breaks throughout the day: A break can help you re-evaluate what you're working on and whether it's something that's inspiring or not. Sometimes taking a step back will give you new perspective that'll spark new ideas. 
2) Be open to suggestions: If you don't have any ideas of your own, sometimes talking with other creatives or reading articles or watching videos will help you develop new ideas.

The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.
