What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something that already exists. Invention ideas can come from anything, from a simple idea to an innovative design. There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some examples: 
1. Inventor: This is the person who comes up with the original idea for the product or service. They may have been working on the same problem for a while and have come up with a better way to do it. 
2. Patenting: This is when someone else comes up with a similar idea to yours, but they have filed for a patent so that you can use their ideas legally. This can give you some control over your invention and make sure it's considered as an original work of art by the public.

How to Use Innovation to Drive Results
Innovations can help businesses achieve success. Here are four ways to leverage innovation to drive results:
1. Use innovation to improve productivity and efficiency. When products are redesigned or new processes are created, employees can be more efficient in their work. This can lead to reduced costs and increased profits.
2. Use innovation to create new markets. When businesses adopt innovative products or services, they may find new customers who would not have otherwise been reached. This can lead to increased sales and a larger profit margin.
3. Use innovation to change the way people live and work. Innovative ideas can help businesses change the way people live for the better, including by increasing efficiency and productivity. This could lead to increased customer loyalty and a higher return on investment (ROI).
