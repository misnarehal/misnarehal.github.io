When to consider a big idea: What are the benefits and drawbacks?
When to consider a big idea is an important question to answer because it can determine the success or failure of your project. There are many factors to consider when deciding when a big idea is the best time to pursue, such as the feasibility of the idea, the potential impact of your ideas, and who will be benefited by your project. Here are four tips on when to consider a big idea:
1. Fidelity – Once you have determined that a big idea is feasible and beneficial, it is important to make sure that it does not conflict with any other projects or commitments you may have. If there are any issues or concerns about whether or not your project would contradict other interests or goals, it may be more difficult to bring your big idea up for consideration. This can lead to shelving the idea altogether or finding another way to make it a reality.

The Invention of the Electric Shock guitar
Electric shock guitars were invented in the late 1800s by George Lukacs, a musician and inventor. Lukacs had been playing an electric guitar that used alternating current (A.C.) to create sound, and he realized that electric guitars could be used for amplification. In 1892, Lukacs developed his first model electric guitar, the Electric Guitar Company's "Lukacs Guitars."
