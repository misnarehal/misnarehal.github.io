The Different Types of Brainstroming:
As we all know, brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of sudden, unexpected thoughts or ideas. Brainstroming can be negative or helpful, and it can be associated with brainstorming sessions or creative thinking. There are three main types of brainstroming: cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal. 
Cognitivebrainstroming is when someone has a suddenZ wave-like experience in their mind that includes new and innovative thought. These thoughts may be related to something that the person has been working on for months or years but never considered before. Emotionalbrainstroming is when someone experiences intense emotions such as joy, sadness, worry, or anger. It can be overwhelming to try and contain these feelings and they will often take over the person's mind completely.

Benefits of creativity: What do you gain from being creative?
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas, ideas that are different from what is currently accepted and/or common, or anything that is original. Creative individuals often have a better imagination and are more creative than those who do not. There are many benefits to being creative, some of which include: increased productivity due to the increased variety of ideas, improved communication and problem-solving skills because of how you can come up with new solutions quickly, and even better grades in school because creativity often leads to new ways of thinking that may be unorthodox but are still effective.

How does brainstroming work?
There is much debate surrounding the impact of brainstroming on cognitive functions, but there is little known about how it works. A recent study by scientists at the University of Utah found that when subjects are exposed to a burst of stimulation their brains release neurochemical substances that improve their cognitive performance. The study also showed that the release of these neurochemical substances was associated with increased activity in areas of the brain responsible for memory and attention.
