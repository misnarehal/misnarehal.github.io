How will new technologies affect our lives?
New technologies are constantly changing and advancing, making it difficult to predict how they will affect our lives. Some potential changes include: 
1) Increased use of AI – This technology is already changing the way we live, with companies like Amazon looking to use AI in everything from customer service to parcel delivery. 
2) Low-cost 4G phones – It’s not hard to imagine a future where everyone has a low-cost 4G phone that they can use anywhere. This could have a significant impact on how we live and work, as well as what kind of services we can access. 
3)Augmented Reality (AR): In 2020, AR will become more prevalent than ever before, with devices like Google Daydream View and Apple’s A12 Bionic Chipset capable of rendering 3D content in real time.

Invention ideas are always something that people come up with on their own, or when they are inspired by another person or idea. There are so many different ways to make things better, and there are so many different ways to make money. There is no one best way to think about invention ideas, and no one best way to come up with them. What matters most is what you decide to do with the ideas you come up with.

Creativity in the world today: What can we do to be more creative?
Creativity has always been a part of humanity. It is what allows us to find new ways to do things and to come up with new solutions to problems. However, creativity can also be used to hurt others or make them feel uncomfortable. In this day and age, we have more opportunities than ever before to use creativity in a positive way, but it is important that we do not abuse it. Here are six tips on how to be more creative: 
1. Be open-minded
One of the most important aspects of being creative is being open-minded. You need to be willing to think outside the box and experiment with different ideas for products, services, or ideas for your own life. This will help you develop new insights and new ways of looking at things. 
2. Use empathy
Another key ingredient for being creative is using empathy.
