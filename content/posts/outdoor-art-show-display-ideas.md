What are big ideas?
Some people might say that ideas are what make the world go round, and for some, big ideas are what get them up in the morning. Whatever your definition of big idea, there’s no doubt that it’s a powerful force in life. Here are five of our favorite big ideas:

2. Take things one step at a time.

Natural gas: The inventor's story
Invention is a process of creating something new from personal experience, creativity, and the applied sciences. Natural gas is an example of an invention that has impacted the world in a significant way. In 1929, John D. Rockefeller Jr. discovered natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania and began developing them into a field known as The Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus Shale was developed to create energy that could be used to power factories and homes; it was also used to produce plastics and other industrial materials. With the rise of renewables such as solar and wind, gasification of natural resources is becoming an increasingly important technique for powering these systems.

How to choose the right tools and materials?
When you are starting a project, it is helpful to have some idea of what you need and what you don't. This can be done by looking at tools and materials that will be used in the project and choosing the right ones for the job. When choosing tools, it is important to think about how they will be used and how they will affect the project. The most important factor when choosing tools is price, but other factors such as ease of use, quality, and durability should also be considered.
