The inventor's journey: From the inspiration to the innovation.
Invention is a process of creating something new, whether it's a product or a service. It can be an idea that someone has for years, or something that they just come up with on the spot. When someone comes up with an invention, there are several steps that they go through in order to make it into a reality. The inventor needs to come up with a concept, create a prototype, and test the product or service before they release it to the public. There are also various other steps that need to be taken in order to bring an invention to market, such as marketing and protection. With such a long journey ahead of them, there are many innovators out there who are working hard in order to make their ideas into reality.
