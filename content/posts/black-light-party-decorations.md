When it comes to the creative process, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it’s important to be open-minded and willing to experiment. Secondly, don’t be afraid to take risks – creativity often comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone. And finally, trust your instincts; if something feels right, go with it.
