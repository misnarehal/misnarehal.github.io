What is innovation and why do we need it?
Innovation is the ability to come up with new ways of doing things. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation is important because it gives businesses and individuals the chance to try something and see if it works or not.
There are a few different types of innovation: scientific, technological, economic, social and cultural. Scientific innovation occurs when scientists come up with new ways to study the world around them and improve our understanding of it. Technical innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make products or services more efficient or effective. Economic innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make money by selling their products or services. Social innovation happens when people come up with ideas for different organizations or societies that could benefit from them.

Brainstroming (So what?) is a process that occurs when the brain migrates from one part of your brain to another. In some cases, this migration can be beneficial; for example, during puberty, the brain shifts from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe. But in other cases, it can create problems. For example, if you are a math genius and want to be a financial advisor, your brain might move to the temporal lobe in order to better process numbers.

The opportunities for big ideas:
There are endless opportunities for big ideas. In fact, many of the world's most innovative companies were started with just a single idea. And while it might seem daunting to come up with a truly groundbreaking concept, there are plenty of ways to get started. Here are four tips for generating big ideas: 1) Brainstorm with others. Collaborating with others can help spark new ideas and increase the chances of success. 2) Don't be afraid to experiment. Trying out new approaches often leads to breakthroughs. 3) Be open to change. Constantly adapting your approach will help you stay ahead of the competition. 4) Stay focused on the task at hand. If you lose focus, your ideas will quickly go away.
