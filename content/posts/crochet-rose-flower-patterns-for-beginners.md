Ideas are what weasel out of hard decisions. They're the alternative that we can't think of or the solution that's too complicated or risky. We're drawn to them because they seem like a way out, but often they're just a way to avoid responsibility. As our world becomes more complex, it's more important than ever to come up with solutions and be relentless in seeking new ideas.
