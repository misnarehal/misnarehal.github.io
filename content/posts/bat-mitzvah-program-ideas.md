How creativity can be used in your work.
Creativity is key in any workplace. Whether it’s creating new ideas for products or services, coming up with solutions to problems, or simply coming up with new ways of doing things, creativity is essential to a successful organization.
But what if creativity wasn’t just reserved for the creative minds of artists and creatives? What if it was used in every day tasks, too? How could creativity be used in your work if you want it to be effective?

One way to use creativity in your work is by using problem solving as a tool. By thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems, you can help make your business more efficient and successful. And while using creativity in your everyday life may not sound as glamorous as being an artist or creative thinker, it can have major benefits at work.

Creativity and risk: What are some dangers of being creative?
Creativity is a good thing, right? After all, creativity is what allows people to come up with new ways to do things. But being creative can also have dangerous consequences. Here are some dangers of being creative:
1) You might not be able to think of anything new. This is especially true if you're someone who's constantly brainstorming and coming up with new ideas. It can be tough when you don't have any fresh ideas in your head, and that can lead to problems.

2) You might not be aware of the risks involved in your work. If you're working on something that you believe in and care about, it's important to be mindful of the risks involved in its creation. But if you're not sure about the risks, then you might not tell anyone about them – which could lead to them getting hurt or worse.
