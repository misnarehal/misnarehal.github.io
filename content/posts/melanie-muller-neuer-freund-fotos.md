How to Make Your Home More Functional
Last year, I was faced with a unique challenge. My home was slowly being used less and less as my office became more and more. To keep up with the trend, I decided to create a few key functional pieces in my home that could help me get more done. Here are some tips on how to make your home more functional: 
1. Make an organized space - One of the most important things you can do to improve your productivity is make sure you have an organized space in which to work. This can be anything from a shelves of books on one side of the room to wires leading out of the windows for potential cable management purposes. 

2. Get rid of distractions - When it comes to working, it’s important to keep things as quiet and distraction-free as possible.

The artist as creator: How does the artist create their art?
Creative artists create their art through a variety of mediums and techniques. They use their creative juices to express themselves, and often work in collaboration with others to produce unique pieces of art. While the artist's process is unique, it ultimately remains the same: they start with a blank canvas, and take turns working on different aspects of their artwork until it is finished.
