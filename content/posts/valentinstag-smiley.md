Types of creativity: Intuitive, logical, creative, and gestural
Creativity is a highly subjective term that can be defined in many ways. Some might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is simply making something new. Whatever definition one chooses, there are some key elements to creative thinking which are all based on intuition. Intuitive thinking often comes from the subconscious and is not based on logical thought processes. This makes it much more difficult to control, but can also be very effective in solving problems or creating solutions.

The benefits and drawbacks of DIY projects
There are many benefits to DIY projects, including the satisfaction of completing something yourself. However, there are also some drawbacks to DIY projects, which can include a lack of knowledge or experience, and even mistakes. Here are four tips for avoiding common pitfalls when creating your own DIY project:
1. Do your research first: When starting a DIY project, itâ€™s important to do your research before starting any project. You donâ€™t want to spend hours trying to figure out how something works only to have it go wrong later on. By doing your research, you can save yourself time and headaches in the long run.

2. Be patient: Donâ€™t be discouraged if you donâ€™t understand something right away. If you can be patient and continue reading instructions, you will eventually get the hang of things.
