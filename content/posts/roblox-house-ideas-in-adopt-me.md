2020: How do we make sure that our 2020 election is fair?
In 2020, the United States will face another harsh election season. Key issues that will be debated include how to make sure that the election is fair and what measures can be taken to prevent fraud. Here are four ideas for making sure that the 2020 election is fair: 
1. Create a public database of all registered electors in order to help ensure accuracy and transparency. This would help reduce voter fraud and make it easier for voters to check whether their ballot has been cast correctly. 
2. Increase the number of voting machines from precincts to whole neighborhoods so that more people can vote in one voting place rather than scattered throughout various precincts. This would improve security and ensure that all ballots are counted accurately. 
3. Make it easier for citizens with disabilities to vote by offering identification requirements or waiving residency requirements in certain cases.

How can we turn big ideas into reality?
How can we turn big ideas into reality? There is no one answer to this question, as the process of turning big ideas into real world solutions will vary depending on the individual and organization. However, some tips on how to make this happen include:
1) Taking the time to think through and come up with a good idea. This means taking the time to think about what could be done, and not just what you’re thinking right now. It can be helpful to have a goal in mind before starting any project, so that you know you won’t get sidetracked.

2) being clear about what you want. Once you have a good idea of what you want, it's important to be sure that everyone involved knows what they need to do in order for that idea to become a reality.
