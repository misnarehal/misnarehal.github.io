How does brainstroming work?
Are you a morning person or an evening person? A night owl or a morning owl? How do you know which type of person your brainstroming is? Scientists have developed a way to measure the activity in the brainstem and it is based on what time of day someone is. This research has been published in "PLoS One" and was done by scientists at the University of Utah."
Brainstroming, also known as brainwave synchronization, is a process that occurs during sleep when different parts of the brain work together. Brainstroming helps to improve focus and concentration, make decisions faster, and achieve goals. The study found that people who are morning people tend to have more brainstroming than those who are evening people. People who are night owls also have more brainstroming than those who are morning owls.

Tips for creating unique and interesting blog posts: How can you make your posts stand out from the rest?
Creating interesting and unique blog posts is a key part of any online writer’s repertoire. There are a number of ways to go about this, but one way that can really set your blog apart from the rest is by using creative writing techniques. Here are some tips for trying out these techniques:
1. Start with a strong opener. Your first sentence should be intriguing and introduce your readers to the topic at hand.

2. Use verbs tense in your writing to make your words feel more alive. This will help keep your reader engaged and motivated to read on.

3. Think outside the box when it comes to plot points and ideas. Not all blog posts need an obvious solution, and instead, you can use them as a jumping off point for new storylines or characters for your blog post.
