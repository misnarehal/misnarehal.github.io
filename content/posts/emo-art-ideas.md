What is invention?
Invention, sometimes called the discovery of a valuable new technology or process, is a moment when an idea or design comes to someone and they decide to put it into use. Invention can be something as simple as a new way of making a product, or something more complex like creating a new method for extracting oil from coal. It can come from anyone â€“ even people who have nothing to lose. Inventors are often able to see their ideas through to the end, and often find new ways to make their products or processes even more effective. For example, inventors who create air-conditioning technology may not have thought about how it would be used in hot climates, but they came up with a better way to cool buildings and this has led to new applications for the technology all over the world.

Creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative processes can vary in their specifics, but all involve the creative process of coming up with ideas, narrowing them down to a few that work well, and then implementing those ideas into a tangible form. Here are three examples of creative processes: 
1. Brainstorming: brainstorming is when people come up with new ideas without any specific constraints. This can be done in private or in group settings, and it's often used to come up with new ways to do something or improve on an existing product. 
2. Design: design is when a product or idea is created from scratch. It starts with the idea and then goes through various stages, including development, testing, and production. 
3. Programming: programming is when someone comes up with a solution to a problem or comes up with a new way to do something.
