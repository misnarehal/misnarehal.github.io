How to Use Nice Ideas to Make a Great Product
Nice ideas are a great way to make a great product. By using nice ideas, you can increase the chances of success for your project. Here are five tips to help you use nice ideas to create a successful product:
1. Start with common problems and solutions. When you start with a problem or solution, youâ€™re more likely to find common ground and develop an idea that everybody can understand.

2. Be specific. If you donâ€™t have a good idea, itâ€™s much harder to come up with something that people will want and use. Be sure to include enough detail so that potential customers can understand what theyâ€™re buying and why they should invest in it.

3. Be willing to pivot.

Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention is the process of creating something new, using an original idea or design. Patent and trade mark are the two most common types of invention. Patent covers a specific invention, while trade mark covers a particular name or symbol that is used by someone else. There are many different types of inventions, but these are the most common:
Patents: A patent is a document that shows that someone has invented a specific product or service. The patent can cover any kind of product or service, from a simple invention to a very complex one.

Trade marks: Trade marks are similar to patents, but they cover specific names or symbols that are used by someone else instead of just products. Trade marks can be registered with the trade mark office and they can be used on products and services.
