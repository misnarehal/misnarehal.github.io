The Psychology of Idea Generation
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that all people have in common. They all want to create something new and exciting, and they all feel like they can do it. This is where creativity comes into play. People are able to come up with ideas on their own, but often they need help coming up with the best ones. Here are four ways to get creative juices flowing:
1. Take on a smaller project: Sometimes the best way to get started with an idea is by taking on a smaller project that you can complete quickly and easily. This will help you get your head around the concept and start thinking about ways that you could improve it.

2. Draw on your experience: When you have some experience under your belt, it becomes easier to come up with powerful ideas.

History of Invention: How did inventions come about?
Invention comes about when a person or group of people come up with a new idea for something and then try to make it a reality. Some inventions, like the printing press and the Internet, were actually born out of necessity- like during World War II when people needed to create documents quickly. Other inventions, like the telephone and the electric chair, were made because someone was just curious or had an amazing idea and didn't want to give up that idea. There are so many different types of inventions, it's hard to choose just one as the history of invention is pretty amazing!

The challenges of innovation: What needs to be done to make it successful?
Innovation is key to keeping businesses on the right track, but it can also be difficult to get started. Here are four challenges that need to be overcome in order for innovation to stay successful: 1) Lack of experience: Many businesses start out with little or no experience in their field. Without a good foundation, it can be hard to build on what has been done before. This often results in poor innovation and product development. 2) Poor communication: When trying to come up with new ideas, it can be difficult to communicate these effectively and efficiently. This can lead to problems such as miscommunication and confusion over what is being discussed. 3) Lack of coordination: In order for innovation to work well, it needs to be coordinated between different departments within a company. This can be difficult when there are different interests and goals at play.
