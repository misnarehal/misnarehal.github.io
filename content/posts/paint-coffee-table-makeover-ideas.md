6) Find a way to offer help or inspiration to others
There are many people out there who need help, and even more people who need inspiration. It can be difficult to know what to do or say in order to offer them both. Here are six ideas for how you could help someone who needs it: 
1. Graphics: Draw a picture or write down a description of the problem or situation that the person is experiencing. This will provide some insight and direction for providing help. 
2. Words of Wisdom: Share your own experiences and advice with the person in question, or recommend books, articles, etc., that can help them out. This will give the person something to look forward to and may also inspire them further. 
3. Opinion: Share your thoughts on what the person should do or how they should go about solving their problem.

The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.

The definition of brainstroming: how it works and what it can do for you
There are many definitions of brainstroming, but the most complete one I’ve found is this: “the process by which a person or organization achieves a goal by using whatever resources they have at hand, including their own brainpower and energy.” Brainstroming can be used for personal or professional purposes. For example, if you want to improve your thinking skills, you may use brainstroming to do so. If you want to become more organized, you may use brainstroming to help with that. And if you want to achieve a goal faster, you may use brainstroming to help with that as well.
