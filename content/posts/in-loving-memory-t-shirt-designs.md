Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other concepts?
Innovation is the process of creating something new and different from what has been done before. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new product, service, or idea that is better than what was available before. Innovation can be found in everything from fashion to technology to business.
If you think about it, innovation is pretty much just a way to make things better. After all, if there was nothing new or different out there to work with, how would anyone ever come up with a new idea? In fact, innovation often comes from coming up with an idea that nobody else has thought of before. So while it may seem like a pretty big responsibility, it's actually quite easy to get started on when you have some basic ideas about what you're looking for.

Definition of an innovative company: What are some key elements that make a company innovative?
Innovation is a process of change that is driven by curiosity, creativity and a determination to improve the quality of life for those who use or will use its products. This definition may be foreign to some readers, but it's something that goes into everything we do at our company. Our objective is to help others achieve the same level of satisfaction that we have found ourselves reaching over the past several years.
