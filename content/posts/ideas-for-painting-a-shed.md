The basics: how to brainstorm effectively
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate new ideas for a project or problem. There are a few basic steps to brainstorming effectively:
1. Define the problem or goal. What are you trying to achieve?

2. Gather a group of people together. Brainstorming is usually more effective with more than one person.

3. Generate as many ideas as possible. The goal is to come up with as many potential solutions as possible, no matter how “out there” they may be.

4. Evaluate the ideas and choose the best ones to implement. Once you have a list of potential solutions, it’s time to evaluate them and choose the best ones to move forward with.
