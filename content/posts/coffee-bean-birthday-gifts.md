History of Invention: From prehistoric times to the present day
Invention has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think and create. From early prehistoric times, people have created objects that have changed the course of history. Some of the earliest inventions include the wheel, fireplaces, and tools. In recent years, technology has allowed for innovations in everything from health care to gaming. Today, there are many different types of inventions available to us, which means there is no one type of invention that dominates the world.
