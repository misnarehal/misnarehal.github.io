2022: What are the new ideas for businesses in 2022?
There are many new ideas for businesses in 2022, including ones that focus on digital marketing, artificial intelligence, and reconfiguration of workforces. Some of the most promising concepts include: 
1. The rise of "Intelligent Manufacturing" - companies that use machine learning and algorithms to optimize production runs and produce more quickly and cheaply. This could lead to a significant increase in jobs in the manufacturing sector, as well as a decrease in the need for human labor. 
2. How AI is changing the way we interact with our environment - through things like 3D printing or autonomous vehicles. These changes could have serious implications for businesses, as they could create new opportunities for cost overruns, bottlenecks, and performance problems.

The challenge of creativity: How do we overcome obstacles and reach our creative destination?
Creativity is an essential part of any person's life. It can be used to create things that no one has thought of before or to come up with new ideas for products or services. However, there are often obstacles that stand in the way of reaching our creative destination. Some of the most common obstacles include lack of experience, creativity being blocked by fear, and a lack of support from those around us. How can we overcome these challenges and reach our creative destination? There are a few ways to start with, but each person's journey will be unique. One approach is to find a group of people who share your same interests and/or goals, and ask them to help you brainstorm ideas. Another way is to read books on creativity or watch videos on the subject. Finally, you can visit art museums and galleries if you're interested in seeing creative works in person.
