Review: What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new recipe to designing a new piece of clothing. However, some creative ideas are better than others. Here are five creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with the basics: Start by brainstorming what your idea could be. What are some things you can think of that could be used in your idea? Examples might include an ornament, a piece of art, or even a little project for your room. 
2. Think outside the box: Once you have an idea for something, start thinking about ways to make it work. What is something that has never been done before? How can you make it unique and interesting? 
3. Be daring: Don’t just take what someone has already done and create something new; go beyond what people usually think of when they think of creativity.

Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.
