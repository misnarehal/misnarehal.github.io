Introduce the topic of creative ideas.
Creative ideas are the core of what drives businesses and industries. They are what inspire people to come up with new products, services, and ways of doing things. Many businesses have creative departments or teams whose sole purpose is to generate new ideas.
There are a number of ways to generate new ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when a group of people get together and try to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or critiquing them. Another way is to look at what other businesses are doing and see if there’s something you can improve upon or do differently.

You can also try asking customers or clients what they would like to see from your business. Sometimes the best ideas come from the people who are actually using your products or services. And don’t forget about your employees!

2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.
