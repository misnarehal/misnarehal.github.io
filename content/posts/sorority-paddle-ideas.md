What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas are powerful things. They can open up new thoughts, possibilities, and ways to approach problems. They can also help you focus on the right things and get productive work done.
But there are a few key benefits of having ideas that can make them even more powerful: 1) you may be able to come up with new solutions faster; and 2) you may be able to turn your brainstorming into a real project if you put in the effort.

So how do you use ideas to their full potential? Here are three tips: 
1) Make sure you have a good idea of what you want your product or service to do before starting any brainstorming process. This will give you a better understanding of what kind of problems or solutions you could consider. 
2) Be prepared to change your mind as often as needed during the brainstorming process.
