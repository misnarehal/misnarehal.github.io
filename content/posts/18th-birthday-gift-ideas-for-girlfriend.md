The future of education: What can we expect from the future of education?
There are many ideas that could be included in the future of education, but one that is gaining a lot of traction is the idea of blended learning. Blended learning involves combining different types of instruction to create a more complete educational experience for students. This can make it easier for them to learn and grow, as well as improve their academic ability.
One potential application for blended learning would be in the area of education. By mixing traditional classroom classes with online or other forms of learning, it would allow students to receive a complete education from various angles. This could help them better understand and apply concepts, as well as develop critical thinking skills.

Another potential application would be in healthcare. By working with different disciplines to create a single course on a specific topic, healthcare professionals could save time and money on training programs.
