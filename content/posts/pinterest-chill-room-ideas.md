Invention as an act or process: What are some examples?
There are many examples of Invention as an act or process. Sometimes people invent things just because they think they can and sometimes people invent things to help others. Inventors often have a vision for what they want their invention to be, and they work towards making that vision a reality. Some examples of Invention include: 
1) Wiring diagrams: Many inventions are born of need, like the Telephone. Mechanical engineers had been working on creating electrical wiring diagrams for centuries before Alexander Graham Bell came up with the idea for theTelephone.
2) The computer: Inventions like the transistor and laser were all born from necessity - computers did not exist until after WWII because scientists could not build them on a large scale.
3) The airplane: Wright brothers flew airplanes in 1903 without any assistance from anyone else!

Businesses and Innovation: How can companies Benefit from Innovation?
Businesses have always been able to benefit from innovation. However, the current economic climate is making it more difficult for companies to receive funding for innovative ideas. This is especially true for small businesses and startups. In order to overcome these obstacles, businesses should look to Innovation Funding programs.

The Benefits of Home made Projects: Why would you want to do any of these projects?

1. Home made projects can be very cost effective: When you take the time to make your own projects, you can save a lot of money on materials and labor costs.

Considerations when renovating or upgrading: What should you take into account when renovating or upgrading your home?
Renovating or upgrading your home can be a great way to update and improve the look and feel of your home. However, there are some important considerations you should take into account when renovating or upgrading your home. Here are a few key points to keep in mind: 
1. Use common sense when renovating or upgrading your home – don’t overdo things and wait until it’s too late. You may not be able to afford to make any necessary changes later on, and you may not have the time or resources to do so. If you wait, you could end up regretting your decision. 
2. Don’t overspend – it’s always better to initially save up money rather than spend more on unnecessary features that won’t actually improve the look or function of your home.

Idea 3: A new way to communicate information
An invention that could be used to communicate information more effectively than ever before is a technology called "messageUltra." This new communication system would use sound waves instead of text or images to convey information. The sound waves would be sent through the air and sent directly to the recipient's ears, allowing them to hear the message without having to read it. This could be an extremely helpful tool for schools, businesses, and other organizations who need to communicate with large groups of people more efficiently.

How to make simple changes that can improve your home
Making simple changes to your home can improve its overall design, function and livability. Here are a few tips to get you started: 
1. Remove any obstacles from your way - remove any fliers, posters or other adornments that areinghamatairport-style wallpaper or carpets. You don't need them and they can add clutter and unsightliness. 
2. Make the living area more inviting - create a dividers wall between the bedroom and living room if you have one and make use of natural light instead of artificial light fixtures. This will help to create a more relaxing environment for spending time in your home. 
3. Add some storage - adding some storage boxes, cupboards or other containers on either end of the couch can seem like a small change, but it can make a big impact in how your home feels and looks.
