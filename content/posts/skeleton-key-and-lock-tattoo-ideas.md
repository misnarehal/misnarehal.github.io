How to come up with big ideas: What tips do you have?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Without big ideas, businesses risk becoming stagnant or even failing. Here are a few tips to come up with big ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is key to coming up with great ideas. Talk to your accountant, banker, or other important professionals about what you want to achieve. They can provide guidance on how to make your idea a reality. 
2. Use brainstorming tools: With brainstorming tools like Scrum, Kanban boards, and Venn diagrams, you can quickly generate potential solutions and understand the different aspects of your problem. 
3. Be open to change: Sometimes it’s best to be flexible when it comes to coming up with big ideas. Don’t be afraid to experiment and see what works best for your business model and product.

The benefits of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is an essential part of any creative person’s arsenal. It can help you come up with new ideas or solutions to problems, or turn your ordinary thoughts into something special. There are many benefits to creativity, and some people insist that it has everything to do with creativity itself. Here are just a few: 
1) Creativity can help you solve problems more effectively. When you have a lot of ideas and options at your disposal, working with only one option can often be the best solution. This is because it allows you to get close to the problem and figure out how to solve it. 
2) Creative people are better at connecting with other people. People who are good at coming up with new ideas often have a lot ofpathy for others. They understand how they feel, and they can use this knowledge to help others solve their problems.
