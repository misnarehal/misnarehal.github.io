Invention as an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution
Invention has been around for centuries, and it is no secret that many creative minds have come up with brilliant new ideas. However, only a small percentage of inventions actually become products or services. This is due to the fact that invention is an act or process of coming up with a new idea or solution. In order to make your invention successful, you must be able to come up with great ideas and have the hustle and determination to work on them tirelessly. If you are able to put in the extra effort, your invention will likely be more successful than those who just sit back and wait for someone else to create something for them.

Tips for Working creatively: What to keep in mind?
Creative ideas can come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to make something new and beautiful. Here are a few tips to help you keep your creative juices flowing:
1. Be open to new ideas – anything that makes you think outside the box can be a good idea for a project.

2. Don’t hesitate to take risks – if something seems too risky, let it be. The important thing is that you don’t give up on your project until it’s finished, or until you find a better way to do it.

3. Take time to relax – working constantly will only lead to stress and fatigue. Instead, take some time for yourself each day, and work on tasks that are more calming and relaxing. This will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the process.
