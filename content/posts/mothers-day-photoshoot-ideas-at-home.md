Others might doDIY projects as a form of art or as a way to express their creative side. Whatever the reason, there are a few benefits to DIYism that everyone should consider. Here are four: 
1) It can save you time and money. When you do your own project, you’re not bound by the same restrictions that other contractors have. You can choose what materials you want and how much work you want to put in, which can lead to savings on both cost and time.

How do we create innovative products?
Innovation is the ability to create new products or services that solve a problem that was not previously considered. For some businesses, innovation can come from coming up with a new way to do something, getting better at what you do, or even creating something entirely new. In other cases, innovation can come from taking an existing product and making it better. Sometimes this is easy- like when a business comes up with a new way to make their product more efficient- and sometimes it takes more effort, like when a company comes up with a revolutionary new technology. Innovation is important because it allows businesses to stay ahead of the curve and give their customers the best possible experience.
