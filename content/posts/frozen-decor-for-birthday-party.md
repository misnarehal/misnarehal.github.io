What are big ideas?
Big ideas are essential to creativity and innovation, and can be the spark that inspires a new idea or a different perspective on an old problem. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they need to be clear, concise, and easy to remember. Here are some examples:
1. A new way of thinking about math could lead to more innovative ways of solving problems. 
2. Improving communication could lead to better cooperative relationships. 
3. Reducing food waste could create more sustainable communities. 
4. Developing new transportation systems could save lives and money. 
5. Thinking outside the box can lead to new solutions for common problems.

Generating Ideas: Ways to come up with new ideas.
There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. One way is to brainstorm with others. This can be done in a group setting or by yourself. Another way to generate new ideas is to do a mind map. This is where you take a blank piece of paper and draw a circle in the middle of it. Then, you start brainstorming around the central idea, branching off into different areas. You can also look for inspiration in other places, such as books, magazines, websites, etc. If you’re stuck, try taking a walk or doing something completely unrelated to what you’re working on to clear your mind and come back fresh.
