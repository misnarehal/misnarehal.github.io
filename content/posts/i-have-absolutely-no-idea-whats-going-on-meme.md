What is big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always come to mind. From economic reforms to social programs, big ideas are always on the radar of policy-makers. However, what exactly makes a good big idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to big ideas, but some key elements include: having a clear vision and goals, being able to develop and test the idea in a meaningful way, and being able to build on existing policies or programs.

This year's Winter Olympics in Sochi may be seen as an opportunity for fresh thinking about big ideas. While many experts predict that the Games will not produce any significant newbig ideas, that does not mean that there is not potential for innovation.
