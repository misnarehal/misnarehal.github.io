What is brainstroming?
Are you feeling overwhelmed and lost? If so, you may be experiencing brainstroming. Brainstroming is a phenomena that occurs when one is overwhelmed and cannot think of anything to focus on. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, and confusion. There are a few things that can help to improve your mental state while suffering from brainstroming. First, try focusing on why you are feeling overwhelmed. This could be as simple as identifying a specific task that you need to complete in order to feel better, or thinking about what others have said or done that has made you feel this way. Additionally, break down the task into smaller goals rather than trying to do the entire thing at once. Doing small tasks multiple times throughout the day will help keep your mind off of the larger issues at hand and will make it easier to stay focused on your goals.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and useful products or services. Innovation can be found in both traditional businesses and startups. A business that is constantly innovating will likely have a higher chance for success than one that is not as innovative. In order to be successful, a business must provide value to its customers and compete with other companies on a regular basis. A startup, on the other hand, does not have the same constraints as a traditional company and can often be more creative in their product development.
