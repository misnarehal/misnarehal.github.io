The Future of Work: How will work change in the future?
According to many experts, the future of work is one in which employees are able to work from home, commute less, and enjoy other forms of leisure. While these changes may sound like good news for workers, they also present some challenges. For example, if people are able to work from home while they have children or elderly parents around, this can lead to tension and stress at home. Additionally, working from home can also lead to a lack of social interaction and communication with coworkers. These concerns make it difficult for companies to determine if the benefits of using remote working platforms outweigh the potential drawbacks. In order to figure out the future of work, companies will need to consider not only the benefits but also the risks.
