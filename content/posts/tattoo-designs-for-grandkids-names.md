Examples of big ideas: From technology to business, there are plenty of examples to give you ideas on how to improve your business.
1. Technology has always been a big part of business. From the printing press to email, technology has shaped how we do business. Today, with the advent of social media and more online tools, businesses are using technology to connect with customers and provide a better customer experience.

what is an invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, a process, or a service. It’s an important part of the business world, and it can be a lot of fun.
There are four main steps to inventing something: idea generation, development, prototyping, and commercialization. First, you have to come up with an idea for something new. This can be inspired by a problem you’ve noticed that needs solving, or by something you think would be cool or helpful to have. Once you have an idea, you need to develop it into a concept that can be turned into a physical product or service. This involves doing market research and feasibility studies to make sure your idea is viable and there’s demand for it.
