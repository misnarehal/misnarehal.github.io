Innovation is the process of creating new ideas. It can be found in everything from technology to business to creativity. Here are four ways to create new ideas:

1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is a great way to get feedback and share your ideas with other people. You can also ask them for their opinion on a particular idea or topic.

3. Go beyond what people think is possible: Sometimes all it takes is going beyond what others think is possible to come up with better ideas.
