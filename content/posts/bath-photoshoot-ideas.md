Conclusion
There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas. Some people keep a running list of things that annoy them, looking for patterns or problems that can be solved. Others look at existing products and try to come up with ways to improve them.
 Brainstorming with friends or family can also be a great way to generate new ideas. And sometimes, the best ideas come when you least expect it—in the shower, while you’re driving, or right before you fall asleep.

The important thing is to stay open to new ideas and be willing to experiment. You never know when that next great invention idea will strike!
