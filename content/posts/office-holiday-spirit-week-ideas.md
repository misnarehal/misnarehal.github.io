The definition of creativity: What does it mean to be creative?
Creativity is the ability to produce new ideas or solutions that are unique and different from those that have been produced before. This may be seen as a natural talent or an acquired skill, but it is still creativity if it is used in an original way. The definition of creativity has changed over time, but the essentials remain the same: creativity involves using your own mind and imagination to come up with new ideas or solutions.
