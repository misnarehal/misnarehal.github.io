Thesis: What are the new ideas?
Some of the new ideas that have been brought to light in the past few years are artificial intelligence, biomarkers and machine learning. In this article, we will focus on one particular idea- artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a process that uses machines to create or interpret text or other forms of information.
