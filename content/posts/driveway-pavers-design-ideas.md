Invention and Technology- What is the difference?
There is a big difference between invention and technology. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, while technology is the use of that idea to make something happen. Invention can be anything from a simple solution to a complex product or service. Shelly Korman, an inventor and business owner, said that invention is the “f initest and simplest form of creativity.” It can be something as simple as coming up with an idea for a product or service, or coming up with a way to do something better than what someone else has done before. Technology, on the other hand, can be anything from making something work better than it ever has before to creating artificial intelligence (AI). There are so many different ways that technology can be used, and there is no one right way to use them all.

Definition: Innovation is the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created.
definition of innovation
One of the key concepts in innovation is the definition of what it is. Innovation can be defined as the process by which a new idea, product, or service is created. This definition could be used to describe many different aspects of innovation, but some are more important than others. For example, innovation can be used to describe the process by which new products are created, or the process by which new ideas are developed.

There are a few different ways to achieve innovation. One way is to brainstorm new ideas and see if anyone has any that you think could work well. Another way is to test out products or services before they're released to see if they work well and if there's enough demand for them. There's also the option of learning from experts and watching them create innovative products or services.
