Ideas are a necessary part of any life. Without ideas, there would be no point in living. Some people think that ideas are just things that people come up with and don't really have a use for, but that's not always true. Ideas can be anything from a new way to cook your favorite food, to the perfect way to improve your work. There is no one right way to come up with ideas, so it really depends on what you're interested in.

History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.
The Dark Ages were an era in human history when creativity was almost non-existent and innovation was virtually absent. While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.
