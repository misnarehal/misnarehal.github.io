What is innovation and how does it differ from other forms of creativity?
Innovation is a term that has been used for different things in different times. It can be considered to be two different concepts, although they have many similarities. Innovation can be defined as the process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. This solution can be something that was previously thought impossible or something that was not even considered possible before. Innovation is also often described as being different from other forms of creativity, which is what this article will focus on. Other forms of creativity may involve coming up with ideas or solutions that are not practical or feasible. Innovation, on the other hand, involves coming up with a new and innovative solution to a problem that people have never seen before.

Implementation: How do we make our ideas into a reality?
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any organization. It can help a company stay ahead of the competition and make new and innovative products. However, it can be difficult to implement new ideas. There are a number of ways to make innovation a reality in your organization. 
One way is to create a culture of innovation. This means that everyone in your organization is encouraged to come up with new ideas and try out new concepts. You also need to provide support for these ideas, whether that means granting credit for invention or providing resources to help them become reality. 

Another way to implementation innovation is through process improvement. By improving the way that you do things, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to develop and/or implement new ideas. This can be done by changing processes or instituting standardized procedures.
