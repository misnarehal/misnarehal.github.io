what is innovation?
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It can be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that solves a problem. Innovation is what allows us to progress as a society and make our lives better.
Without innovation, we would still be living in caves and eating raw meat. Innovation is what led to the creation of fire, which allowed us to cook food and stay warm. Innovation is also what led to the invention of the wheel, which made transportation much easier.

Innovation is not just about creating new things, but also about improving upon existing ideas. For example, the first cars were very crude and unreliable. But over time, through innovation, they became more reliable and efficient.

Innovation is essential for businesses to grow and compete in today’s global economy.

How to overcome creative blocks
If you're feeling stuck creatively, don't despair. There are a number of things you can do to overcome creative blocks and get your ideas flowing again.
One helpful approach is to brainstorm with someone else. This can give you some fresh perspectives on the problem you're trying to solve.

Another tactic is to take a break from whatever you're working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is some time away from the project to see it in a new light and have that breakthrough idea.

And if all else fails, there's always the tried-and-true method of just sitting down and forcing yourself to start writing or painting or whatever it is you're struggling with. The hardest part is usually getting started, but once you get going, the ideas will start flowing again.
