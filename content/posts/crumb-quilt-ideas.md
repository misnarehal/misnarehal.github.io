Trends in mobility: How will new transportation systems make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks?
In the coming years, new transportation systems are going to make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks. One of the most significant changes will be the growth of ride-sharing services. Ride-sharing platforms allow people to borrow a car from someone else, and then use it to drive around town or go to different places. This type of transportation system is becoming more popular every day, and it is just a matter of time until it becomes more widespread.
Another major change in the future will be the increasing popularity of bike lanes. Bike lanes are special pavement designs that help cyclists have more space to move around. These lanes are often built near busy intersections so that drivers can’t easily run into them.

But what some people might call "brainstroming" – the sudden onset of intense thought or activity – is actually a natural process that happens when your brain is in overdrive.

Implementation: How do we make our ideas into a reality?
Innovation is one of the most important aspects of any organization. It can help a company stay ahead of the competition and make new and innovative products. However, it can be difficult to implement new ideas. There are a number of ways to make innovation a reality in your organization. 
One way is to create a culture of innovation. This means that everyone in your organization is encouraged to come up with new ideas and try out new concepts. You also need to provide support for these ideas, whether that means granting credit for invention or providing resources to help them become reality. 

Another way to implementation innovation is through process improvement. By improving the way that you do things, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to develop and/or implement new ideas. This can be done by changing processes or instituting standardized procedures.
