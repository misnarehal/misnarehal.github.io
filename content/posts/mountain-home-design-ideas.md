Citation: How should an inventor be cited?
An inventor should be cited when creating or referencing a work in any form, whether it be in an academic article, book, thesis, or patent application. Citing an inventor correctly can improve the accuracy and legibility of your work, as well as prevent others from plagiarizing your invention. To properly cite an inventor, follow these simple steps:
1. Identify the inventor(s) responsible for your invention. This can be done by finding their name and contact information on patents or other sources that list inventors.

2. Research the specific invention you are referencing to try to determine which author wrote about that invention specifically. If you're referencing a work written by several authors, it's often helpful to identify which author wrote about each innovation in order to better understand how they could have been cited for this particular innovation.

Innovation is the key to success. It has been said that necessity is the mother of invention. This may be true, but without innovation, an invention is simply a solution to a problem that has already been solved. Innovation takes an invention one step further by not only solving a problem, but doing so in a way that is unique and original. This is what separates successful businesses from those that fail.
