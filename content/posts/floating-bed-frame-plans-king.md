What are some tips for finding new ideas?
There are a variety of ways to find new ideas, but some tips can help you out. Here are a few: 1. Try brainstorming with someone else – working together can help you come up with many ideas that didn’t occur to you before. 2. Listen to music or watch a movie – both can be great sources for inspiration. 3. Take on new challenges – if something interests you, take on it no matter what. 4. Find a group of people who share your interest – this can be helpful in finding groups of people who also want to explore new ideas as well. 5. Draw on your own experiences – even if they aren’t specifically about ideas, taking on something that has already happened in your life and applying it to the problem at hand can lead to some great insights.
