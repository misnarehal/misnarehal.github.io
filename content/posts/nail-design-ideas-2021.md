Creative problem-solving:
Creative problem-solving is a key part of any creative person’s toolbox. By solving problems, you can produce high-quality work. Here are a few tips to help you explore and solve creative problems:
1) Do your research before you start anything. When starting something new, it’s helpful to know what others have done and how they’ve solved similar problems. This will give you an idea of how to approach the problem and what steps should be taken next.

2) Take your time. Don’t try to do too much at once. If you hurry, you might not get the results that you want or need. Time allows for moreassing thought and creates a better atmosphere for creativity.

3) Be patient. Don’t expect everything to go as planned the first time around.

Idea 4: Write about a time when you created something new and loved it
When you're feeling inspired, your best bet is to focus on something that's new and exciting. Whether it's a new project or an idea you've had for a while but haven't put into practice, taking the time to start creating is always a good way to get ahead. Here are four creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with an old project – sometimes the most interesting things come from giving something up and starting from scratch. If you have an older project that you don't use as often anymore, give it a try again. Not only will it be more interesting and challenging, but you'll also have more experience and knowledge to work with.

2. Take on a new challenge – sometimes one of the best things about being creative is finding new ways to do things.
