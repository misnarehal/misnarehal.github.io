Overcoming creative blocks:
When it comes to creative blocks, the best way to overcome them is to be prepared with a toolkit of ideas. This way, when you hit a wall, you have something to fall back on. Here are four tips for ensuring that your toolkit is always full:
1. Be curious and ask questions: When you're stuck, it's often because you're not sure what you want to achieve. Asking yourself - and others - questions can help clarify your goals, and open up new possibilities for how to achieve them.

2. Take inspiration from others: A great way to jump-start your own creativity is to look at what others have done. See what inspires you, and then adapt those ideas to your own purposes.

3. Give yourself time and space: Rushing into things rarely leads to good results.

But what is innovation? To many, it seems like a vague concept or something that happens behind the scenes. But innovation is actually a process that starts with a idea and runs until it’s realized. In fact, it’s often the ideas that don’t quite fit into existing models that are breakthroughs in innovation.

There are several types of innovation: product, process, service, and market research. Product innovation occurs when companies create new products or improve upon old ones. Process innovation occurs when companies come up with ways to do things better or faster than they have before.
