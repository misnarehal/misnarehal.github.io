what brainstorming is, how it can be useful
What is brainstorming?
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate ideas and solutions. It involves a group of people coming together to share ideas and find new ways to solve problems. Brainstorming can be useful in a variety of situations, such as when you're trying to come up with new ideas for a project or when you're trying to find a way to solve a problem.

There are a few things you should keep in mind when you're brainstorming. First, it's important to have an open mind and be willing to share any idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy it may seem. Second, it's important to build on other people's ideas and try to come up with creative solutions that are outside the box. Finally, don't be afraid to have fun with it!

Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.
