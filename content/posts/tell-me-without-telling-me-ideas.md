The power of a big idea: can change the way we think and see the world
Big ideas have the power to change the way we think and see the world. They can challenge our assumptions and help us to see things in new ways.


For example, the big idea of evolution has helped us to understand the diversity of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. The big idea of gravity has helped us to understand how the universe works. And the big idea of relativity has helped us to understand the nature of time and space.



Big ideas can also change the way we see ourselves and our place in the world. The big idea of human rights, for example, has helped us to understand that all people are equal and deserving of respect. The big idea of democracy has helped us to understand that everyone should have a say in how they are governed.



So what is your big idea?

Brainstorming: techniques for generating ideas
Generating ideas can be a daunting task, whether you’re starting a new project or looking for ways to improve an existing one. But with a little creativity and some structure, the process can be much less intimidating.
Here are a few brainstorming techniques that can help you generate ideas:

1. Brainstorming with someone else. Collaborating with someone else can help stimulate new ideas and perspectives that you may not have thought of on your own.

2. Use prompts. If you’re struggling to come up with ideas on your own, prompts can be a helpful way to get the creative juices flowing. You can use prompts from books, online resources, or even make up your own.

3. Take a walk. Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to take a break from thinking about it altogether.
