What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from changing the way you look at an everyday object to starting a new business. There are so many ways to be creative and have fun, so it's hard to know where to start. Here are some ideas for creativity: 
1. Make something that you've never seen before. This can be anything from a new design for your home to making your own clothing line. 
2. Be creative with your time. When you're not working, spend time outside or in nature. This will help you get out of your head and into the world around you. 
3. Take on a new challenge. Whether it's learning a new skill or trying something new, there's always something to explore when it comes to being creative.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be an idea, a product, a service, or a process. Inventors are people who create new things. They have inventive minds and are always looking for ways to improve upon what already exists.
The invention process involves four main steps: ideation, development, prototype testing, and commercialization. Ideation is the stage in which an inventor comes up with an idea for a new product or service. Development is the stage in which the inventor turns the idea into a plan and begins to create a prototype. Prototype testing is the stage in which the prototype is put to the test to see if it works as intended. Commercialization is the stage in which the invention is made available to consumers.

Inventions can be either big or small.
