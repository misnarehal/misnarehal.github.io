Inspiration is a necessary part of the creative process, but it is not the only factor. In order to be creative, you need to have a good idea and be able to put that idea into practice. Inspiration can come from things like your own experience, books you read, films you watch, or even people you know. If you can get inspired by what you see and hear, your creativity will increase by leaps and bounds.

Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.
